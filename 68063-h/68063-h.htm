<p class="ph2">THE RED VINEYARD</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter I<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Little Speculation</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“I’ll give you just three nights in the front line
trench before your hair will turn grey,” said a brown
haired priest, looking at me with a slightly aggressive
air.</p>

<p>I remained quiet.</p>

<p>“You’ll not be very long in the army till you’ll wish
yourself out of it again,” was the not very encouraging
assertion of a tall, thin priest who suffered intermittently
from dyspeptic troubles.</p>

<p>Still I did not speak.</p>

<p>Another priest, whose work was oftener among old
tomes than among men, said slowly and, as was his
wont, somewhat seriously, that it surprised him very
much to note my eagerness to go to war. He did not
consider it in keeping with the dignity of the priest
to be so belligerently inclined. Did I not recall that
I was an ambassador of the meek and lowly Christ—the
Prince of Peace?</p>

<p>Had I obeyed the first impulse, I think my reply
would have been colored with a little asperity; but as
I was weighing my words, a gentle white-haired old
priest, stout and with red cheeks, said to me as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
smiled kindly; “Ah, Father, you are to be envied.
Think of all the good you will be able to do for our
poor boys! Think of the souls you will usher up to
the gates of heaven!”</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly from side to side two or
three times, and the smile on his kind old face gave
place to a look of longing as he continued, somewhat
regretfully: “Ah, if I were a younger man I’d be with
you, Father. All we older men can do now is to pray,
and you may rest assured I shall remember you often—you
and your men.”</p>

<p>I looked at the old priest gratefully. “Thank you,
Father,” I said, and I thought of Moses of old, with
arms outstretched.</p>

<p>None of the other priests spoke for a while, and I
gazed into the fire of dry hardwood that murmured
and purred so comfortably in the large open fire-place,
built of small field stones. I was thinking earnestly
and when the conversation was again resumed I took
no part in it. In fact, I did not follow it at all, for
I was wondering, among other things, if my hair would
really turn grey after a few nights in the front line
trenches. However, I did not worry; for I concluded
it would be wiser to wait until I should arrive at the
trenches, where I might have the evidence of my senses.</p>

<p>I gave but a passing thought to the words of the
good priest who was a little dyspeptic. He had never
been in the Army, and where was his reason for assuming
that I should not like the life? Of course, I did
not mind what the old priest, whose work was so often
among old books, had said about my being an ambassador<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of the Prince of Peace. I felt that this priest
had got his ideas a little mixed. Not very long before
I had heard him vent his outraged feelings when the
French government had called the priests of France
to fight for the Colors. He had been horrified. So I
surmised that he imagined I had voluntarily offered
my services as a combatant. I had not.</p>

<p>The conversation continued, but I heeded it not. I
was busy meditating on the words of the saintly old
priest with the red cheeks. How well he understood,
I thought. And the flames of the fire shot in and out
among the wood, purring pleasantly the while.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Bishop Writes</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Up to this time I did not have the Bishop’s consent.
In fact, I cannot remember having mentioned in his
presence my desire to go to the front with the soldiers
as chaplain; but I had talked it over frequently with
priests, and it never occurred to me that the Bishop
had not heard of my wish, nor that he would not be
in accord with it. But one morning I received a letter
from the Bishop telling me plainly and firmly that he
wished me to keep quiet, and not to talk so much about
going to the front until I should know whether or not
I would be permitted to go. He mentioned a recruiting
meeting of a few nights previous, at which I had offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
my services as chaplain to the battalion that was
then being recruited in the diocese.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had been a little too outspoken at the
meeting, but I had considered myself quite justified in
breaking silence, since it had already come to pass
that three ministers of different Protestant denominations
had offered themselves as chaplains to the battalion
which, though still in rather an embryonic state,
gave promise of being complete in a few months. I
foresaw that it would be more than half Catholic, as
the population of the district from which it was being
recruited was three-fourths Catholic. So I offered myself
generously, not wishing to be outdone by the ministers,
and then had sat down feeling that I had done
well.</p>

<p>The following morning, however, I was not quite
so sure, for when I read my words printed in the daily
paper I felt just a little perturbed. What would the
Bishop think? I wondered. I had not long to wait
before I knew exactly what His Lordship thought.
His letter told me quite plainly.</p>

<p>I kept quiet. Keeping quiet, however, did not prevent
me from following with interest the activities of
others. Almost every evening recruiting meetings were
held in different places throughout the diocese, at
which old men spoke and orchestras played, and sometimes
a young boy would step dance. But, most important
of all, many young men enlisted. They came
in great numbers, the Catholics far in the majority.
Then, one morning early in the spring, the paper announced
that the battalion had been recruited to full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
strength. The different companies would stay in the
town till the following June, when the battalion would
go into camp to train as a unit.</p>

<p>That evening a letter came from the officer in command,
saying that as eighty per cent of his men were
Catholics he had decided to take a Roman Catholic
chaplain, and that he intended going to see the Bishop
that evening.</p>

<p>A few days later another letter came from the Bishop
saying that he had been asked for a Catholic chaplain,
and as he remembered that I had seemed very eager
to go with the men, he was glad to say that he was
giving me permission to go. He had decided this, he
added, on the Feast of the Seven Dolors of Our Lady.</p>

<p>“The Seven Dolors,” I said to myself quietly, two
or three times. Then I fell to wishing that the Bishop
had made his decision on some other feast of Our Lady.
I remember now, as I stood in the quiet little room
with the letter in my hand, recalling the words of the
priest—that he would not give me three nights in
the front line trenches before my hair would turn
grey. But this thought did not bother me very long,
for I began to think of something else, and as I did
the letter trembled a little with the hand that held it.
“Perhaps I am not coming back,” I said to myself.
Then I repeated: “The Feast of the Seven Dolors!
The Feast of the Seven Dolors!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Little Adjusting</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>During the next seven or eight days from all sides
I heard one question asked by young and old: “When
are you going to put on the uniform, Father?” Little
children to whom I had taught catechism rushed around
corners or panted up narrow streets of the little town
where I was stationed and smilingly asked me. Their
fathers and mothers, after saying good-morning, remarked
pleasantly, as an afterthought: “I suppose
we’ll soon be seeing you in the khaki, Father?” They
seemed to anticipate real pleasure in seeing me decked
in full regimentals. But the more I had evidence of
this seemingly pleasant anticipation, the less inclined
I felt to appear publicly in my chaplain’s uniform.
When the time came for a last fitting at the tailor’s,
I found other duties to claim my attention, until a
polite little note from the proprietor of the establishment
informed me that my presence was requested for
a last fitting of my uniform.</p>

<p>Then one morning, when the spring birds that had
returned were singing merrily among the trees with
not the slightest thought as to their raiment, and when
bursting buds were making the trees beautiful in their
eagerness to drape them with bright green robes, I
appeared on the public streets of the quiet little town
clad in full regimentals.</p>

<p>I had chosen an early hour for my public appearance,
thinking that my ordeal would not be so trying.</p>

<p>Since that morning I have had many exciting experiences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
up and down the ways of war; I have witnessed
many impressive scenes, beautiful, terrible, and
horrible, but these events have by no means obliterated
from the tablets of my memory the events of that
morning. Nothing particular happened until I had
descended the hill and turned the first corner to the
right in the direction of the town post-office. A horse
was coming at a leisurely gait down the quiet street,
driven by a young fellow of about sixteen, who sat on
the seat of a high express wagon with a friend. Both
lads seemed to see me at once, and started perceptibly.
In his excitement, the driver pulled on the lines and
the startled horse jerked his head quickly, as if he, too,
was struck by my unwonted appearance. On the opposite
side of the road a barber, who was operating on
an early customer, stopped suddenly and came to the
window, the razor still in his hand, while his patient,
almost enveloped in the great white apron that was
tucked about his neck, sat up quickly in the chair and
turned a face half-covered with thick, creamy lather
towards the window. All along the way people stopped,
looked, smiled pleasantly, and then passed on.
I had almost entered the post-office when the rattling
of an express wagon, that must have passed the winter
uncovered, as every spoke in the wheels seemed loose,
came noisily to my ears. The horse was reined up
opposite me, and as I turned my head side-wise I was
greeted by the two young fellows who had passed me
but a few minutes before, only this time three other
lads, with smiling faces, were standing behind them
in the wagon, holding to the seat.</p>

<p>After I got my mail from the box, I decided not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to return by the same route along which I had come.
There was a more secluded way. It was with a feeling
of great relief that I found no one coming in my
direction. I took out my new khaki handkerchief, unfolded
it and wiped my brow. But, alas, for my relief!
I had not gone very far till I crossed a street running
at right angles to my course. A number of school
children were coming along this. I quickened my pace.
They saw me, and immediately a great bubbling of excited
talk was borne to my ears. Then, as I disappeared
from their view, I heard the sound of many eager feet
pattering up the sidewalk. It ceased suddenly and I
knew that again they were regarding me intently.
There was a complete silence for a second or two, then
I heard quite clearly the voice of a little girl, who in
the last year’s confirmation class had given me more
trouble than any other of the candidates, call almost
louder than was necessary for her companions to hear:
“Oh! doesn’t he look lovely?” A man just coming
from his house on his way to his office smiled pleasantly
and interestedly as he heard the small voice. Then he
raised his hat. I saluted.</p>

<p>As I walked up under the trees clothed in their
beautiful spring garments, and listened to the birds
that sang so blithely this bright cool spring morning,
with never a thought as to their raiment, I wiped my
brow again. “These military clothes are warm,” I
said to myself—yet I knew that this was not the
reason.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Portable Altar</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>After a few days a box about one foot and a half
long, one foot high and nine inches wide, arrived. It
was made of wood covered with a kind of grey cloth,
with strips of black leather about the edges and small
pieces of brass at every corner. There were leather
grips on it so that it could be carried as a satchel.
It was my little portable altar, containing everything
necessary for saying Mass. One half opened and stood
upright from the part containing the table of the altar,
which when opened out was three feet long. Fitted
into the oak table was the little marble altar-stone,
without which one may not say Mass. In the top of
the upright part was a square hole in which the crucifix
fitted to stand above the altar; on either side were
holders to attach the candlesticks. From the wall that
formed a compartment in the upright portion, where
the vestments were kept, the altar cards unfolded;
these were kept in place by small brass clips attached
to the upright. Chalice, ciborium, missal and stand,
cruets, wine, altar-breads, bell, linens, etc., were in
compartments beneath the altar table. The whole was
wonderfully compact and could be carried with one
hand.</p>

<p>As I write these words it stands nearby, sadly war-worn
after its voyage across the ocean, and its travels
through England, France, Belgium and the Rhineland
of Germany. I have said Mass on it on this side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the ocean; on the high seas; in camp in England; in
trenches; on battlefields; in tents, camps, and billets
through the war-scarred areas of France. I offered
the Holy Sacrifice on it placed on a low, wide window-sill
in a German billet on our way through the Rhineland.
It was carried across the Rhine December 13th,
1918, in the great triumphal march. Now it is home
again. In many places the cloth covering is scraped
and torn; one of the brass corners is missing. It is
very soiled from the mud of France and rifle oil stains,
etc.; the leather edging is chipped and peeled. The
table has been broken and repaired again, so has the
little book-stand. The silver chalice and paten are
slightly dented in many places. The little bell has lost
part of its handle, but its tone is still sweet. One alb
has been burned, but I have another. The cincture has
been broken and knotted.</p>

<p>I gaze at it now and think of the thousands of great-hearted
lads who knelt before it, often on rain-soaked
fields, or stood among piles of ruins and heard the
sweet notes of the little bell warning them of the
Master’s approach, so that they might bow reverently
when He came; of the thousands on field, on hillside,
in caves and huts who knelt to eat of the Bread of Life,
many of them going almost immediately with this
pledge of eternal life, before God to be judged,—as I
think of all this, there comes into my eyes a mist, and
the little portable altar grows dim.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter V<br />


<small><span class="smcap">In Training Camp</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>In a few weeks we left for training-camp, travelling
all night and arriving at our destination early in the
morning. We detrained and the whole battalion fell
in, the band marching at the head of the column. Our
camp was in a wide green valley, as level as a floor,
flecked with hundreds of white bell tents; and in the
distance on every side sloped gently upwards high
solemn mountains that kept silent guard over the
plain below. Through the whole length of the valley
ran a long grey asphalt road, over which passed all
the traffic of the camp.</p>

<p>All summer long battalions of new soldiers came
up this road and took over lines that had been assigned
them. All summer long, and well on into the autumn,
battalions of trained soldiers marched down the road
to entrain for the port of embarkation for overseas.</p>

<p>We marched up the smooth road, the band playing
the regimental march, passed line after line of the
different battalions quartered on either side. Soldiers
from different units lined the way and voiced friendly
criticism as to our appearance, etc. Many wagons
from the farmlands beyond the hills were drawn up
on each side of the road; grouped about them were
many khaki-clad lads buying milk, little pats of butter,
buns and a number of other articles. We marched
about two miles till we came to a great square of unoccupied
bell tents. Here we halted and took over our
lines.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>In a few days we were in the ordinary routine of
camp life, and I think most of the men liked the new
order. Living in a tent seemed to give one a continual
feeling of freshness and buoyancy. Every morning,
very early, far away at general headquarters, a flag
would run up the tall flag-pole; then from all parts
of the camp would sound the reveille, breaking in on
the peaceful repose of honest sleepers, and when the
last sound of the bugles had died away there would be
heard a quick rattle of snare-drums and a few great
booms from the bass drum, then the exhilarating strains
of a military march would break on the morning air.
I had listened to the pleasant martial strains for perhaps
a week or two, and naturally associated with
them the idea of orderly marching bandsmen, fully
equipped, polished and shining from head to foot, till
one morning I untied the flap of my tent and looked
out. More than half the bandsmen were in their shirt
sleeves; five or six were in their bare feet, and now
and again they jumped spasmodically, as they walked
on a pebble or struck a hidden tent-peg; some who
wore boots did not wear socks or puttees, and the
trousers from the knee down were tight and much
wrinkled, yet there was no lack of harmony in the
stately, marching music.</p>

<p>All day long till four o’clock the men drilled or
took different exercises, while the sun slowly shifted
scenery on the great silent hills. Up and down the
long grey road huge-hooded khaki motor lorries
rumbled with their loads of supplies for field and tent.
In the evening towards sunset, after the men had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
washed and rested a little, the flag that had been flying
at headquarters all through the day would drop slowly
down the pole. Then two buglers would sound retreat,
after which the guard would be inspected while
the band played some slow waltz or minuet.</p>

<p>To me this seemed the happiest hour of the daily
military routine. The day was done and from all parts
of the camp could be heard low, pleasant talk, as the
band played soft music, the men standing about in
little groups or moving from tent to tent, visiting
neighbors. It always brought to my mind the idea of
restfulness and peace.</p>

<p>After retreat the long grey road would become alive
with the continuous movement of soldiers going and
coming. The officers did not care to walk along this
road, as it meant for them one continual return of
salutes. Sometimes an open-air moving-picture show
would be in progress. There were also two halls where
moving pictures were shown on rainy nights. In the
early days it was a treat to the lads to visit these places.
As there were never any ladies present, smoking was
permitted. Sometimes the smoke rose in such density
that it obscured the pictures on the screen.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock last post would sound and weary men
would roll themselves in their blankets on the hard
ground and dispose themselves to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Mass Out of Doors</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>On Sundays I would set up the portable altar on two
rifle boxes placed one above the other, on a great green
plain near the end of the camp. Nearly always an
awning would be erected above the altar, and whenever
the wind blew canvas was draped about posts as
a windshield, so that the candles might not be extinguished.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight to see the men draw up
on the grass, every one of them reverent and quiet
before the little altar as I vested for Mass. Often
three thousand were drawn up on the green plain as
level as a floor. Sometimes a number would wait till
this late Mass—which was always said at ten o’clock—to
go to Holy Communion, though I always said an
early Mass for those who wished to receive.</p>

<p>Since the war, different men who were present at
those open-air Masses have told me that never before
had they assisted at the Holy Sacrifice with such devotion.
All things seemed to praise God; the great
solemn mountains stood silent, the clouds moved soundlessly
across the blue of the sky. Not a sound could
be heard, save when a man coughed softly, or when
the little bell tinkled.</p>

<p>On account of what happened, I recall one of those
Sunday mornings in particular. I had noticed, standing
among the officers of one of the battalions drawn
up in the church parade, an elderly man wearing ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
blue civilian trousers and a military khaki shirt
and helmet. He wore a leather belt but no coat. I
no sooner saw him than I said to myself: “An old
soldier!” And as I vested for the Holy Sacrifice the
question came flashing across my mind again and
again: Who can he be? What war was he in? When
I turned after the Communion to address the men,
there he was standing, well in front with the officers.
He listened very attentively to my sermon, which was
on the text, “Son, give me thy heart.” Towards the
end I said a few words about Our Lady, because it
was the Sunday within the octave of the Assumption.
I told the lads to run to their Mother in all their
trials; to be Knights of Our Lady, to think of her
especially during their long hours of sentry duty at
night, and never to let a day go by without saying her
beads.</p>

<p>Then, after I had given my blessing and had turned
to unvest before my little portable altar, my “old
soldier” came forward and introduced himself. He
was a judge from my home province, and he would
be glad if I would permit him to say a few words to
the men. I was very pleased that he should do so.
A word was said to the officers in charge and the men
were called to attention.</p>

<p>The judge stood up on the rifle box that I had just
vacated, and there in God’s beautiful out of doors,
with the great green mountains looking up to their
Creator in silent humility, this old Catholic gentleman
spoke to the lads in a wonderfully clear voice of
their Mother and his Mother. It was very edifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to hear this educated Catholic layman speak so. He
concluded with a few words about the Mass. “I
have assisted at Mass,” he said, “in many large cathedrals
in different countries; but, I think, never with
such devotion as I have this morning here in the open
air before your little altar placed on the rifle boxes,
and God’s beautiful sky and sunlight above us. After
all, gentlemen, it is the Mass that counts; the changing
of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood
of Christ. God could do it and God did do it.” When
the old man finished I could not but say gratefully:
“God bless you, judge,” for I felt that his words
would do very much good.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Little Indignation</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The time passed quickly for me, though I think for
most of the men it went slowly; they seemed always
restless, always longing to get to the front. They used
to come to me often with their little grievances. They
seemed to think that their troubles would disappear
once they reached training-camp overseas.</p>

<p>I remember one Sunday, after I had finished Mass
and the last company had marched off the field, two
soldiers came forward from somewhere and saluted.
One of them, the taller of the two, acted as chief
spokesman. “Father,” he said, “we have not heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Mass today. We were ordered to go to the Protestant
service.” Excitement flashed in his eyes. “The service
is just over, Father, and we slipped over here to
tell you.”</p>

<p>It was strictly against <i>K. R. &amp; O.</i> to order Catholics
to a non-Catholic service. The lads did not belong to
my battalion, but to a construction battalion that had
but lately come to camp. Headquarters of this battalion
were not far away, so I did not wait for my
breakfast, but obeyed the first impulse and went immediately
to the training square of the No. — Construction
Co. The church parade was over and the
chaplain had just finished packing his books and was
preparing to leave the field with the adjutant. I
asked the chaplain if the Catholics had been ordered
to attend the service. “Yes,” he said, and then went
on to explain that it was a universal church service
and that all the men had been ordered to attend.</p>

<p>I asked him to look up a book entitled <i>K. R. &amp; O.</i>
I told him that it was a serious offense that had been
committed; that my men had a right to attend their
own service; that there was no such thing known in
the army as a universal church parade.</p>

<p>When they saw they had made a mistake both chaplain
and adjutant were very apologetic. Shortly after
this, when the battalion was to leave for overseas, the
chaplain wrote me a note asking me to hear the confessions
of the Catholics. I think they came to a man;
two other chaplains came to help me. This construction
battalion was composed mostly of men who had
moved quite a lot over different parts of the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and had grown a little slack in the observance of their
religious duties. Big things were done for Our Lord
that night. Perhaps many would have passed the
summer without even coming to Mass had not this
great indignity been offered them.</p>

<p>So the days passed quickly, and then one evening
word came that we were to leave—but only for another
camp. There was great rejoicing at first, for
the lads thought that orders for “Overseas” had come.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter VIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">We Break Camp</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was Sunday, October 1st. It was the most beautiful
day I have ever seen. There had been a heavy frost
during the night, and in the morning the hills, which
had been green all summer, but had lately begun to
put on their autumn tints, were glorious in bright
scarlet, yellow and russet, with still here and there
a dark-green patch of spruce. The white frost was
on the ground and a covering of ice one-eighth of an
inch thick was formed on the basin of water in my
tent. The air was cold, clear and invigorating. The
men were all in excellent spirits. I said Mass for my
own men, and then walked about two miles towards
the entrance to the camp to say Mass for the other
soldiers who still remained in the different areas. The
Sabbath-day stillness seemed more intense than ever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Perhaps it was on account of the very small number
left in the camp. When I turned around after I had
said Mass, I could not but pause in admiration of the
wonderful beauty of God’s works. I took for the
text of my sermon: “O Lord, Our Lord, how admirable
is Thy name in the whole world.” I told the lads
that as Our Lord had made all things beautiful we
ought to keep our souls beautiful in His sight, and
that one of the surest means of doing so was to come
to Holy Communion. Then I preached on the Blessed
Eucharist.</p>

<p>When I reached our own lines after Mass nearly
all the tents had been taken down and rolled up. I
had breakfast at one of the men’s cook stoves. We
were to break camp at twelve o’clock. I think I was
the only one who was sorry to leave.</p>

<p>Things had gone very well during the summer;
there had been many consolations in the ministry.
Many men who had passed long years away from the
sacraments had come into the white bell tent pitched
in the open space in the valley and, kneeling there,
had been reconciled after many years’ estrangement
from God. I had watched the men in the evening and
had noticed how cheerful they were, how much like
boys they were in the tricks they played on each other.</p>

<p>One evening, shortly before we were to leave, a great
bonfire had been lighted. All through the day the
men had worked at the base of the slopes cutting down
dry trees and carrying them out. The fire was built
in the square where the men drilled and took their
physical exercises in the mornings. It was a thrilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sight to watch the little tongues of fire darting in
and out among the pile of dry twigs, increasing in
size and speed till they developed into one great waving
pillar of flame that tore its way upward through the
gigantic pile of dry old trees, hissing, crackling and
roaring as it went. The flames must have reached
forty feet in height, and at times the sparks swarmed
down on the tents like bees to a hive, and the soldiers
had to beat them out. The band marched around the
flaming pillar and played, keeping always within the
circle of light made by the fire. Many soldiers followed
in procession, some of them performing comical
acrobatic feats as they went. There was an almost
new tent floor up near the colonel’s tent which some
of the lads thought would make excellent fuel for
the fire. Presently about eight of them were carrying
it towards the flames. The quartermaster, who
had charge of the movables of the camp, saw them
approaching and immediately advanced from his place
near the fire, angrily shouting orders to them to put
down the tent floor. They did, though not till the
indignant quartermaster was very near them. Then
they turned and ran quickly away. The quartermaster,
who was a heavy man, did not pursue them. He turned
towards the fire, but only to find that a number of
rough tables and chairs had gone to satisfy the hungry
flames! He was very angry. The lads had become like
little children, and I think their souls had become like
the souls of little children.</p>

<p>And now we were going back to civilization! Our
journey was one of about four hundred miles through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
many small towns and cities to a camp near the seaboard,
where we were to wait a few weeks before embarking.
We left Valcartier at the time appointed,
and all that day and most of the evening our route
lay along the noble St. Lawrence. In the morning
we came into our own Province of New Brunswick,
from the northern part of which our battalion had been
recruited.</p>

<p>In many towns at which we stopped liquor was procured,
and soon there were evidences that many of
the men had taken too much. And when we drew near
the town from the environs of which the majority of
the lads had been recruited a great number gave signs
of almost complete intoxication, so that parents who
stood among the great crowd which had gathered to
see the lads as they passed through were greatly humiliated.
I felt sick at heart, for a public holiday had
been proclaimed and people had come from the whole
surrounding countryside to see the battalion for the
last time before going overseas. It was a gala-day.
They had waited all morning, and then many of the
men who arrived were in every stage of intoxication!
It was very humiliating to the poor parents and the
men had been so good all summer!</p>

<p>When the train pulled out, I went back to my seat
in the Pullman. Two thoughts were working in my
mind, so that my head felt a little dazed and I did not
hear the officers talking around me. Neither did I
perceive when they spoke to me. One thought was a
very human one. I felt terribly disheartened, and I
wondered if the people thought that the men had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
drinking so during the summer, and I fell to wishing
that they could only know all about the men in camp.
The other thought was that I was grateful to God for
having chosen me to minister to them. For surely they
needed a priest!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Panel of Silk</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following Sunday, when all my Catholic soldiers
were assembled at Mass in the church of the town
where we were encamped, I spoke of what had transpired
during our journey from Valcartier. During
the week I had thought out a plan, and I had bought
a few packages of blank visiting cards and a number
of lead pencils. I had cut the pencils in two and had
put a part in every pew, also a blank card for every
person that would sit in the pew. In the course of
my little talk I spoke of how fine a thing it would be
if they could take the pledge, given in such a way,
however, that they might be free to take the rum
served in the trenches, which, under those circumstances,
could be considered medicine. Those who
would take the pledge would write their names on
the blank cards; the cards would be gathered up after
Mass; the names would be typewritten on a panel of
silk; the silk, bearing the names, would be used as a
lining for my little portable altar, and whenever Mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
would be said, a special remembrance would be made
for the lads who had taken the pledge.</p>

<p>When we gathered up the cards after Mass they
numbered almost two hundred. They were typed on
the panel of silk, and the panel of silk, with the names,
still rests in the little altar. All through the war they
have been remembered. Many of those names appear
elsewhere on small white crosses “where poppies
grow,” so that now they are no longer mentioned in
the memento of the living; but there is another part of
the Mass when they are remembered—with “those
who have gone before us, signed with the sign of faith,
and who rest in the sleep of peace.”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Movement Orders</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We did not stay very long in our new camping
ground. For a few days the men seemed quite content.
Everything was new to them; but soon they began
to wonder how long it would be before we would
leave. The nights often were very cold in the tents,
for it was now late in October. We began to feel sure
that orders for departing must come soon as no preparations
were being made for going into winter quarters.
On Sunday I had announced confessions for the
following Wednesday. On the day set, four priests
came to help me, but just as the men were being formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
up to go to the church, word came that we were to
leave that evening for overseas. The men were dismissed
and soon there was a scene of general disorder;
but on all sides were happy faces. All seemed glad
to go. They had been looking forward to it for so
long a time.</p>

<p>I was obliged to tell the priests who had come so
far that there would be no confessions. I kept the
hosts that the Sisters in a nearby town had made for
me, as I hoped to hear the men’s confessions on the
boat on the way across the ocean.</p>

<p>All night long we stood around, waiting for the
train to come to take us, but there had been some delay,
and so it was not till early in the morning that
we left. Our journey was not a very long one, but we
were obliged to wait at many different stations till
trains passed us. As the movement order had called
for a night trip, no dining-car or buffet had been attached.
The men went hungry all day. The last trip
had been one of over-indulgence. This was one of
abstinence.</p>

<p>We had no breakfast and no dinner, yet the men
seemed quite content, and joked pleasantly over the
fact that they were hungry. At one country station
where we were side-tracked the bugler jumped out on
the platform and blew the call: “Come to the cook-house
door, boys!” But as there was no cook-house
door to go to, and no “Mulligan battery”—the name
given to the field-kitchen, with its steaming odors of
Irish stew—they greeted the call of the smiling bugler
with derisive laughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>At four o’clock we were all aboard the <i>S. S. Corsican</i>,
and at five we pulled out from the dock, the band on
the upper deck playing “Auld Lang Syne.” Many
relatives of the lads, who had arrived in the little seaport
town, waved their good-byes from the dock as
the boat swung clear from its moorings and steamed
slowly down the bay. The boys swarmed up the rope
ladders and cheered; many little tugs far down on
the water darted about, shrieking shrilly their farewells.
We were off to the war!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The High Seas</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The doctor and I had been alloted a stateroom together,
but I was subsequently given one down below,
where I said Mass the first morning and heard confessions
every evening. The chief steward was a
Catholic and he was very kind. I had permission to
say Mass in the second-class saloon, which was the
largest on the boat, and nearly all the men came to
Holy Communion. Our first Sunday out I said Mass
for the lads below. As I proceeded with the Mass the
seas became very rough, so that the book fell off the
altar three times; the chalice, however, never moved.
Many became sick, and the Red Cross section was
busy. On the first day out we donned our cumbersome
life-belts, which we wore all the way across the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
I took mine off only while saying Mass. They
hung on the berths at night. During the day the men
walked up and down the upper deck; sometimes there
were drills, etc. We saw no vessels. Every day we
plunged forward through rough seas, and in the afternoons,
as I sat in my little stateroom hearing confessions,
I could hear the dull pounding of the waves on
the sides of the vessel.</p>

<p>I was very pleased with the example the Catholic
officers gave the men. Every one of them came to
confession and Communion on the way over. One, the
old quartermaster, who was confined to his cabin with
a severe attack of <i>la grippe</i>, could not come to Mass
with the others, so I gave him Communion in his cabin
towards the last of the voyage. The second morning
afterwards, however, as I walked back and forth making
my thanksgiving, I stopped quickly and peered
out over the sea. I could see very faintly, across the
water, a long, serried line of hills that looked greyish-blue
in the early morning—the hills of Ireland! I
ran quickly to tell the quartermaster, who had been
born in Ireland and had still a true Irishman’s great
love for his native land. He was not there. I was
surprised, as the doctor had told me that he had given
orders that he was not to leave his cabin till after we
reached port. As I went out on deck again I noticed,
up forward, leaning over the gunwale and looking towards
Ireland, a great muffled figure. He wore one
khaki great coat, and another, thrown loosely about
his shoulders, gave him a hunched appearance. It was
the quartermaster!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>I went forward quickly: “Captain,” I said, “didn’t
the doctor tell you not to leave your stateroom till we
docked?”</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything for a second or two, and I
noticed a mist had come into his eyes. Then he pointed
far across the grey waste of waters. “Ah, Father,”
he said, “but there’s Ireland!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">By Ireland</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>All day long we sailed by Ireland and she seemed
strangely peaceful and quiet. Perhaps it was the great
contrast with the sea, the wide tumbling waste of
waters that, night and day, was always restless; or
perhaps it was a benediction resting over the whole
country. Anyhow it seemed that way to me as often
as my eyes rested on the hills and fields of holy Ireland.
Since that morning I have seen many different
countries. I have come back to my own land over the
same great distance of waters, and it was in the early
morning that I saw it first, yet that strange spiritual
peace that seemed to rest over Ireland was decidedly
lacking. That early morning scene still comes back
to me; and all through the day, whenever my eyes
rested on the hills of Ireland, I felt that I was making
a meditation and that I was being lifted in spirit far
above the little things that bother one here below.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Down below us on the water, with the swiftness almost
of swallows, darted here and there the long grey
anti-submarine boats. Seven or eight of them had
come to meet us. Later on in the day appeared the
mine sweepers, low short steam boats painted for the
most part red, and carrying one yard sails. The sails
were of dark brownish-red color. They worked in
pairs.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">England</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>That evening we moved slowly up the Mersey and
at nine o’clock anchored out in the stream in full view
of the city of Liverpool. We could not see it very well,
for throughout the city the lights were dimmed and
windows were darkened.</p>

<p>All along the Irish coast the impression was one of
peace and quiet, a spiritual something. But England
seemed to give one the idea of a great machine, working
slowly, steadily, untiringly. One was spiritual;
the other material. That was my first impression of
England as a nation, and that impression remained with
me during my stay in the country. Every time I returned
on leave from France I found it always the
same. England, as a nation, seemed to be wonderfully
organized, and that whole organization seemed to run
smoothly, powerfully, and heavily. Each individual
had his special work to do in that colossal workshop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
called England. He knew how to do that, and he
did it, quietly, methodically, and well. But, taken
away from his own work, he seemed to lack resource—the
resource and initiative of the men from the New
World.</p>

<p>We entrained early in the morning. For most of
us it was our first experience with the compartment
cars of the Old World—little compartments running
the width of the car, a door opening from each side
of the car, with two seats running from one side to the
other, each holding from three to five people, who sat
facing each other.</p>

<p>We passed through many quaint towns and many
large cities, and it was evening when we came into the
quiet little station of Liphook. We were due there
at two o’clock, but there had been many delays along
the way. Sometimes the lads had pulled the rope and
had stopped the train; and each time a stolid brakeman
had opened the door of compartment after compartment,
asking solemnly: “’oo pulled the reope?” Of
course no one gave him the information he asked;
whereupon he closed each door and went patiently on
to the next compartment.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">In Camp</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I have often remarked that English writers use the
word “depression” much more frequently than do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
writers on this side of the water, and I have often
wondered what could be the reason for this. I had
not passed one week in England before I knew. A few
days in an English military camp will give one an idea
of what depression is.</p>

<p>The military camp to which we were sent was Bramshott—a
great collection of long, low, one-story huts,
built row on row, with a door at each end, opening into
muddy lanes that ran the whole length of the camp.
It was raining mildly the evening we arrived and we
marched in the darkness for three miles along soft
muddy roads, and now and again we splashed through
a puddle, though we tried to avoid them.</p>

<p>There seems to be an especially slippery quality
about the mud of England,—to say nothing of that
of France—that makes it very difficult to retain one’s
balance. My cane, which according to military regulations
I always carried, for the first time now proved
useful. Day after day as the soldiers of the camp
drilled in the soft, muddy squares, their movements
resembled sliding more than orderly marching. Sometimes
thick pads of the soft, yellow mud clung heavily
to their feet; very often a gentle drizzle of rain fell,
and nearly always the sky was dark grey and sombre,
so that one wondered no longer why the word “depression”
should be so frequently used in English literature.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the mud and the dark skies,
many of us grew to like England. There were many
quaint, winding roads hedged in places with hawthorne
bushes or spruce or boxwood. These led us into delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
little country villages with their old free-stone
churches, sometimes covered with ivy that often ran
for a long distance up the old Norman tower.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Cenacle</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Not more than three miles from the camp was situated
the convent of the Sisters of the Cenacle, a beautiful
three-story building of red brick and stucco hidden
away among great hemlock, spruce and cypress
trees. It is a kind of rest house, where at certain seasons
of the year retreats are given for ladies, who come
from different parts of England and pass a week at
the convent.</p>

<p>All during the war there was an open invitation to
the Catholic soldiers of Bramshott Camp to visit the
convent on Sunday afternoon and assist at Benediction
of the Most Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>There were three or four different ways of going to
Grayshott, near which the Convent of the Cenacle was
situated. One of these was a foot-path which led first
through a moor, covered in summer with purple heather,
then through bracken, almost as high as an average
man, and bunches of green gorse bushes that blazed
light yellow at certain seasons with flowers resembling
in shape the sweet-peas. It was a quaint little path,
passing on its way “Wagner’s Wells” a chain of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
we on this side of the Atlantic would call ponds, in
a low, wooded valley. In summer these were very
pretty when the full-leafed branches of the trees hung
low over the Wells, and the water was almost wholly
hidden by tiny white flowers that rested on the surface.
All during the war, on Sunday afternoons, a
long, irregular line of khaki-clad figures went leisurely
along the foot-path to Grayshott, passed scenery
strange though pleasing, mounted quaint rustic stiles
till they came to the convent of the Sisters of the
Cenacle.</p>

<p>The first Sunday I visited the Convent there were
so many soldiers present that the little chapel could
not contain all. I learned afterwards that this had
happened so frequently that, in order that all might
be present at Benediction, the good Sisters had asked
for and obtained a general permission to have the services
on the lawn just in the rear of the chapel.</p>

<p>Benediction was given by a little Belgian who was
doing chaplain’s work among the Canadians at Bramshott,
while Father Knox, a recently converted Anglican
clergyman, led the soldiers in singing the hymns.
Little red hymn-books, which the English government
had supplied the Catholic soldiers, were passed around
to each soldier. It was a beautiful sight there on that
English lawn, as all knelt grouped together, officer and
soldier, priest, sister, while the white Host was raised
to bless us all. Then the lads sang strongly and clearly
that beautiful hymn, “Hail, Queen of Heaven,” that
was sung so often during the war under many different
conditions. The Irishmen sang it as they advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
to take a difficult position that the English had failed
to take at Féstubert.</p>

<p>The Sisters dispensed hospitality; large teapots of
tea and plates stacked high with thin slices of bread
and butter, and baskets of thick slices of yellow cake
with currants in it. Then in the evening the soldiers
walked back to camp through winding foot-paths and
over stiles.</p>

<p>I am sure there are many men scattered over the
country who will remember gratefully the Sisters of
the Cenacle at Grayshott. It must have inconvenienced
them greatly, yet Sunday after Sunday, all during the
war, soldiers went to the convent, and always the
Sisters treated them most hospitably.</p>

<p>On Sundays, when the number of men present was
not too large, Benediction was given in the Sisters’
chapel. It was a very pretty little chapel and on the
altar, day and night, the Sacred Host was exposed for
perpetual adoration; and always two Sisters knelt to
adore. On the Gospel side of the altar stood a beautiful
statue of the Blessed Virgin which was almost
covered with the military badges worn by soldiers of
the different battalions. In some way known to women
the good Sisters had draped a mantle about the statue,
and to this was pinned the badges of these modern
knights.</p>

<p>After Benediction the lads would all come to a large
room where tea would be served. Often among the
little khaki-clad groups a Sister of the Cenacle would
be seen standing, or sitting, listening to the stories
told of the country far away across the seas. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Sisters wore a black habit, a small purple cape which
reached to the elbows, and a white cap covered by a
black veil, except for a one inch crimped border around
the face. Sometimes, when it was time to leave the
convent, a certain group would step forward to say
good-bye to the Sisters and to ask their prayers. These
would be men ordered to leave during the week as a
draft for some battalion in the trenches. And the lads
“would be remembered in the Sacred Presence there,
where remembrances are sacred and each memory holds
a prayer.” Day and night, as the Sisters knelt before
the Lord and offered their continuous prayers for a
world that seemed to have forgotten Him, special
prayers were said for those whose badges hung on
Our Lady’s mantle.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Battalion is Broken Up</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We were not in England three weeks when orders
came for a draft of men to reinforce a battalion that
had suffered severe losses at the front. In a few days
one hundred and fifty men left for France. We thought
at the time that reinforcements would soon come to us
from Canada, but not much more than a week passed
till we were called on for another draft. This time the
order was that three hundred and fifty men be sent to
the Eighty-seventh Battalion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>This second order came as a shock to us all. Many
of the officers had been in the battalion for almost a
year; they had watched it grow strong and numerous
and had helped to form, the thing most essential in a
battalion, an “esprit de corps.” I had never thought
of going to the front except as a unit. The idea of
our being broken up had never entered my mind, but
before Christmas came our battalion had lost its identity
as the One Hundred and Thirty-second Battalion,
and the majority of the men had gone to join different
units at the front. It was impossible for me to be with
all my men, as there were no two drafts in the same
brigade; still, I thought that I might be permitted to
go as chaplain to the brigade in which was the largest
number of my men, so I obtained permission to go to
London to explain matters to the senior chaplain. He
was very kind, but he said I must await my turn; there
were other chaplains whose battalions had undergone
the same process of annihilation as had mine. These
must go first; work would be found for me in England
till my turn would come to go to the front.</p>

<p>I returned to Bramshott Camp a somewhat wiser man
as to the workings of things military. But as I sat in
the cold first class compartment, with my feet on a
stone hot water-bottle (seemingly this is the only way
they heat the cars in England) my mind was busy
with many things. One was that I never should have
offered my services as chaplain had I foreseen the
catastrophe which had befallen us. I had counted on
being with my men till the last. Before leaving for
overseas many of the mothers of the lads had come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
me and had told me what a great consolation it was to
them to have the assurance that a Catholic priest would
be with their sons. Now I was not going with them;
still, I had been convinced that the lads would be well
cared for spiritually.</p>

<p>At Bramshott I became assistant for a time to the
camp chaplain, Father John Knox.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Little Spaniard</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had not been given very much information at headquarters
as to how soon I might be sent to the front,
for they did not know how soon the call might come
for chaplains.</p>

<p>In a few days the remnants of my battalion left
Bramshott for a camp at Shoreham-by-Sea—all save
a few, who stayed as officers, servants or clerks in
different branches at headquarters.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was sitting before Father Knox’s
tiny fire-place in his little room, talking of the Sunday
church parades, when a very young soldier entered,
saluted, passed Father Knox a letter and then stood at
attention. I did not notice the lad particularly, as
Father Knox read the letter in silence, for my eyes
were on the small heap of glowing coals in the grate
before me, and my mind was busy on a scheme to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
all the men in the camp at two church parades on the
following Sunday.</p>

<p>As Father Knox began to write the answer, he looked
up from the paper and asked, “Catholic?”</p>

<p>Then for the first time the lad began to speak, hurriedly,
and with foreign accent. His eyes took on a
queer strained expression; his head seemed to crouch
down to his shoulders.</p>

<p>It transpired that he was a Spaniard and had been
brought up a Catholic, but after going to Canada had
been accustomed to go to Protestant churches. He
was now orderly to a Protestant minister and had received
a few books from him including a copy of the
New Testament in Spanish, so at present, his religion
was the “Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p>I had already turned from the fire and was watching
the lad. It was the first time I had ever heard a
Catholic speak so, and I felt a great pity for him. But
quickly the pity gave place to other emotions, for in
reply to Father Knox’s question as to what battalion
he came over with, he said “One Hundred and Thirty-second”—my
own battalion! Slowly a dazed, nauseating
feeling chilled me. Such a thing to happen!
I was responsible to God for this man’s soul; and
apparently he had lost his faith!</p>

<p>I questioned him a little, only to learn that now he
was orderly to a Baptist minister and that it was he
who had given him the New Testament in Spanish.
I appointed an evening for the lad to come to see me.
He came and we talked for a long time, but he seemed
to be strangely obsessed. The more we talked, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
more I noticed the queer, strained expression in his
eyes, and when he left me that night I feared I had
not done very much towards reviving his faith. It
was many months before I saw him again.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XVIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Garrison Church Hut</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The days passed quickly. New battalions from home
came and took up quarters in camp, and to their surprise
were broken up and sent in drafts to France.
Every night Father Knox or I remained on duty in
the little garrison hut, that the lads might have an
opportunity of going to confession before leaving for
France.</p>

<p>The garrison church hut had been built by the military
authorities for the use of all religious denominations.
It was used on Sundays by the Catholics, or, as
the Army Equivalent has it, R. C.’s, at seven o’clock
for the Communion Mass for the men. The Protestant
denominations had the use of it all the rest of the day.
There was a little altar on which the Anglicans offered
their Communion service, but we never used this.
Father Knox had an altar of his own, on rollers, which
was moved out in front of the other one before Mass
and wheeled back after Mass.</p>

<p>Just outside the entrance to the hut had been erected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
a large blackboard for announcements of services. Always
on Saturday night this board held the order of
the Anglican services. We had never interfered with
this, as the Anglican is recognized as the official religion
of the British army. However, one Saturday evening
as I came out alone from the hut I happened, in
passing, to glance at the board. The customary announcements
were not there; instead, was written in
bold white letters the order of Catholic services for
the morrow. Not only was the notice of the camp service
given, but the Benediction at Grayshott Convent
was mentioned also. For a few seconds I stood gazing
at the sign, in great surprise. Soldiers passing along
the little lane paused to read and then passed on. I
knew Father Knox could have had nothing to do with
it. Then, as I stood there in the night looking at the
announcement board, I smiled. “Tim Healy,” I said,
“Tim Healy!”</p>

<p>Tim Healy was a lieutenant who had come over from
Canada with an Irish battalion. Like many another
it had been broken up and Tim was waiting anxiously
his turn at the front. He had been born in Ireland
and was a near relative of the great Tim Healy. The
following afternoon I saw him at the Convent of the
Cenacle. I went across the room to where he was sitting,
and waited till he had finished his tea. Then,
without any preamble, I said: “Mr. Healy, why did
you erase the announcements on the board outside the
church and put the Catholic order on?”</p>

<p>Tim forced an expression of innocent wonder into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
his face, which, I thought, was a little too elaborately
done; but almost simultaneously appeared a pleasant
twinkle in the eyes of him.</p>

<p>“No, Father,” he said, “I didn’t,” then he smiled
broadly and his eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>I looked at him in great surprise, for I was almost
certain that he had done it. But Tim had not finished,
and as his eyes continued to twinkle said quietly: “But
I sent one of my men to do it. I hope he did it well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I said grimly, “I think it was done well—if
not too well.” However, nothing ever came of it.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The New Sacrifice</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Things went much the same at Bramshott. Spring
came, and for the first time I saw the primroses, which
are among the first flowers to bloom in England. They
do not belong to the aristocracy for one sees them
everywhere; along railway embankments, along the
roadsides, near the hedge-rows, everywhere patches of
the pretty little yellow flowers smiled the approach of
spring.</p>

<p>Then one day when the spring birds, nesting in the
great old English trees, were cheering up the poor
war-broken lads that lay on their little cots in so many
military hospitals throughout the country—Vimy
Ridge had been fought, and many of the lads who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
sailed with me had fallen that victory might come—word
came that I was to join the Fifth Canadian Division,
which was then preparing to go overseas.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day when I left for Witley Camp
where the Fifth Division was quartered. The birds
were chorusing their glorious melodies from hedge and
tree and field; but along lanes that should have worn
a peaceful country setting went clumsily great motor lorries
in different ways connected with the war.</p>

<p>Witley Camp was only six miles from Bramshott,
so it did not take us long to speed over the Portsmouth
road through the beautiful Surrey country.</p>

<p>I took up temporary quarters with my old friend
Father Crochetiere, and slept on a table in his office.
I was not very long there when another old friend
dropped in to see me in the height of Father Hingston,
S. J. Both priests welcomed me very kindly and told
me I was just in time to help in the remote preparation
for a stirring event. They spoke with great enthusiasm,
and it was not long before I was made aware of
the cause. A Solemn High Mass was to be celebrated
in the open air the following Sunday, and the Catholic
soldiers from all parts of the camp were to attend in
order to be consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
There were more than three thousand Catholic soldiers
in the camp. The following Sunday morning I was up
very early to help in the preparations.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning. The sun was up, clear,
bright, and warm. The air was very still. Though
preparations, both military and religious, had been
most carefully made, there was discernible in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
manner of the priests who had worked so hard for
the bringing about of this great religious ceremony
some signs of anxiety. They feared lest there be a
hitch in the deliverance of orders, so that all the men
might not be present. There was no need to fear,
for at 9:30 o’clock three thousand Catholic soldiers
drew up in the grove of pines on the border of the
lake at the northwest corner of the camp and all
anxiety disappeared. There were French Canadian
lads from the Province of Quebec; Irish Canadian
Rangers from Montreal; Scotch laddies, with feathers
in their caps, from Ontario and Nova Scotia; Indian
lads from Eastern and Western Canada.</p>

<p>An altar had been built against one of the very
few oak trees that stood in the grove of pines, and
above the cross that stood upon it, a large picture of
the Sacred Heart of Jesus was nailed to the tree; surmounting
all was a canopy of larch and ivy leaves.
Daffodils, tulips and larch stood out brightly among
the candles on the white altar. All about the carpeted
elevation on which the altar had been built stood many
potted plants.</p>

<p>As the parade was drawn up beneath the trees, on
the carpet of dry pine needles and the last year’s oak
leaves, bands of different battalions played and the
kilted laddies made music with their pipes.</p>

<p>Father Crochetiere sang the Mass, with old Father
McDonald, who had come over as chaplain to a Scottish
battalion, as deacon and the writer as sub-deacon.
The choir of thirty voices which sang the Royal Mass
so beautifully was under the direction of Lt. Prevost
of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Battalion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>And so under the British oak where “Druids of old”
once offered their pagan sacrifices, the Holy Sacrifice
of the New Law was offered, and Canadian lads knelt
to adore. And there by the quiet lakeside the miracle
of God’s wonderful love was wrought, and the promise
made by the Divine Master on the border of another
lake, the day following the multiplication of the loaves
and fishes, was fulfilled. For many of the soldiers had
waited till this late Mass to go to Communion, and
under the beautiful sunlight that filtered through the
trees they knelt to receive the “Bread of Life.”</p>

<p>After Mass a short sermon was preached in English
and French by Father Hingston, S. J., chaplain to the
Irish Canadian Rangers, in the course of which he
explained clearly and beautifully what the ceremony of
consecration meant.</p>

<p>Then Colonel Barré, commanding the One Hundred
and Fiftieth Battalion, read the Act of Consecration
to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in French, and Major
McRory, officer commanding the One Hundred and
Ninety-ninth Irish Canadian Rangers, read it in English.
Each soldier was then presented with a badge
of the Sacred Heart.</p>

<p>And just as of old the multitude who followed the
Divine Master were blessed before they departed, so,
after the Consecration to the Sacred Heart had been
made, the lads knelt while Benediction of the Blessed
Sacrament was given, and then all was over. “He
blessed them and sent them away.”</p>

<p>As I stood that day by the little altar near the
lakeside, while bands played and the lads fell in preparatory
to departing, I could not help thinking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the many different places where they had worshipped
since they had left Canada; and though I could not
foresee the strange scenes they would inevitably meet
on the red road of war, which they would shortly
travel, still I felt sure that one day would stand out
in their memories in bold relief—the day they made
the Act of Consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus,—the
day when they knelt before God’s altar built
in the open air under the trees by the lakeside—and
Jesus passed!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Through English Lanes</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The early summer in England, especially in Surrey,
is very beautiful, and as the work was light we had
many opportunities to walk through the lovely country
roads. But even prettier than the highways were the
lanes that led off from them and went winding, with
their hedges, through copse and field, and quaint little
red-brick villages, each with its century-old, ivy-covered
church that had come down from the good old
Catholic days. In some of them a statue of some
saint still stood, and in many were ancient holy-water
stoops and baptismal fonts.</p>

<p>Often gigantic chestnut or oak trees, grouped near
a quaint old gate, told us of the entrance to some
baronial estate or castle; but nearly always our only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
view of the estate was a piece of road with very carefully
trimmed box-hedge or a great blazing hedge-row
of rhododendrons, and a small white board, attached
to a gate-post or tree, which informed the passing wayfarer
that there was “No Thoroughfare.”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to steal away from the camp
and the sounds of shouted orders, and practicing military
bands and bugle notes, to the quiet country where
the birds sang blithely and the strange notes of the
cuckoo’s solitary call from some distant tarn or wood
came sweetly to the ears; one forgot, for the moment,
the thought of war and all associated with it.</p>

<p>I remember one afternoon I had taken a walk with
Father Hingston and Father Crochetiere down a shady
lane that wound, for the most part, through a high
woodland, when we came suddenly to a small village
of seven or eight houses. To our right was a long
box-hedged foot-path, winding through a field or two
till it was swallowed up in a grove of tall, full-leafed
beech and oak trees that stood presumably before a
rich country seat. But we did not take the foot-path
to the right. Instead, the priests,—both had been
here before,—turned to the left and presently we
had passed through a little gate into a very small but
lovely rose garden. A tiny path, with a tiny boxwood
hedge not more than a foot high, led from the
gate to the door of an old-fashioned white house. Just
before the door was built a latticed portico, over which
climbing roses grew. We were admitted by an elderly
housekeeper and were asked to go upstairs.</p>

<p>There we found a priest whose age might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
forty-five and whose hair was just beginning to turn
grey about the temples. He was about medium height,
rather slight, with an ascetic face. He was sitting in
a low room which was very bare save for a table on
which were some morning papers. Across the hall
was a room in which was a great old-fashioned fire-place
with an ingle-nook. The priest’s name was
Father McCarty, but he spoke with a decidedly English
accent. He was a member of a religious community
known as the Salesian Fathers. Knowing that he had
such a very small parish, I asked him if he found the
time heavy on his hands. He replied that he did not;
and that although he had only three or four families
in all, including the rich household of Capt. Rusbrook,
whose large estate we had passed on entering
the village, he was quite busy, as he was writing the
life of the founder of his order, Don Bosco; he also
from time to time helped the chaplains at Witley
Camp.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">At Parkminster</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>There was a different spirit in Witley Camp than
there had been at Bramshott; for in the whole division—twelve
battalions of infantry and three brigades of
artillery, etc.,—was the one feeling of expectation of
soon going overseas. Any day the orders might come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Father Hingston had made a retreat in London, and
Father Crochetiere had just returned from five days’
rest and prayer at the wonderful monastery of the
Carthusian Fathers, at Parkminster. I decided to go
there.</p>

<p>The following Monday, late in the afternoon, I drove
up the winding drive, through hawthorn hedges, to
the gates of the monastery. Everything seemed very
quiet; no one appeared in garden or window. A bell-rope
hung outside the blue-grey door. I pulled it
quickly. From somewhere within came a great clanging,
and almost simultaneously a clatter of heavy boots
on stone flags. Inside, a bolt shot back, and immediately
a white-garbed, white-bearded old brother stood
before me, smiling in the opening. He shook hands
with me and bade me enter.</p>

<p>“We have been expecting you, Father,” he said,
with that gentle courtesy that one finds in a religious
house. He took my grip, notwithstanding every protest
and led me along the rough, stone-floored corridor
to the Guest House, where I was given a large, airy
corner room, plainly though adequately furnished.
Snow-white sheets were on the bed—I had not seen
sheets for a long time.</p>

<p>The old white brother told me to sit down,—that
presently the Retreat Master would come. Then he
left me. I went over to a window and looked out.
Just below was a large garden with rose-fringed walks,
enclosed by a very high stone wall. Outside the wall
green fields, fringed with dark trees, stretched far
away. Beyond these, rolling Sussex downs, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
greyish-blue in the summer haze, rose to meet the skyline.</p>

<p>A strange peace was everywhere, and save for a
slight nervousness that seemed to have come to me
with the great silence of the house, I was glad that
I had come.</p>

<p>In a little while a knock sounded on the door and
the Retreat Master entered. He was not very tall, and
rather slight, and though his hair was grey he was
not old. There was nothing very distinctive in his
face, now rough with a three-days’ growth of beard—the
rule of the order is to shave every fifteen days—and
there was not much color in his cheeks. The eyes
were small, grey and almost piercing. But there was
that same indefinable atmosphere of peace about him.
It seemed as if he had stepped aside from the great
noisy highway of the world to listen in silence to the
voice of God. Yet, as he talked, the Father seemed
to take a childish interest in all that I told him of
my experiences in a great military camp with officers
and men of the world. But away below the wonder
that rippled over the surface of the spirit of the monk
there seemed to be great depths of silence, and as I
tried to fathom these depths, I felt a strange helplessness
come over me. I could not understand this man
who sat smiling simply and cordially, and at the same
time seemed to be enveloped in an atmosphere not of
this world.</p>

<p>Before he left for the evening the Retreat Master
pointed to a card that hung on the wall. “The Order
of Retreat,” he said. “You will be able to follow it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>I assured the Father that I would, and then he was
gone for the night.</p>

<p>My retreat passed very quickly—I had only five
days—and during that time I forgot all about war
and preparations for war. Every day for about half
an hour the Retreat Master came to my room and
talked a little. He told me many things about the
monastic life that I found very interesting. Each
monk, he explained, lived in a little brick two-story
house which was attached to the great main corridor
that formed a quadrangle about the church. The
lower story was a kind of workshop in which was a
lathe and different kinds of carpenters’ tools, and to
it the monk descended in his free time to do manual
work. A small garden, in between the different houses,
was allotted to each monk, where he worked for a
while each day and grew vegetables for his own frugal
board.</p>

<p>One day I told the Retreat Master that I had read
a description of Parkminster in one of the late Monsignor
Benson’s novels, “The Conventionalists.”</p>

<p>The monk smiled reminiscently. He recalled the day
that Mr. Benson—he was an Anglican at the time of
his visit—in company with another minister, had
called. Mr. Benson had seemed very much interested.
The other had made some strange remark. Monsignor
Benson had never visited the Monastery as a priest,
nor had he ever brought any one there to join the
community. The monk assured me of this, and he had
been Guest Master for many years. Yet when I had
read “The Conventionalists” I had been almost convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that the story related was a personal experience.
It may have been to some other monastery that the
young man had gone, although Monsignor Benson had
said Parkminster.</p>

<p>Shortly before I left the monastery the Retreat
Master came to have a last chat. “When you reach
the front,” he said, “tell your men that we are praying
for them day after day, night after night.”</p>

<p>I felt a strange feeling of security on hearing these
words, but as I left the monastery gates and turned to
say farewell to the old monk, I felt a distinct sinking
of my heart. “Perhaps,” he said rapturously, “you’ll
be a martyr!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Orders For France</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Not a week had passed after my retreat, when one
morning a runner from divisional headquarters came
into my hut, saluted and passed me a paper. I was
ordered to France. This was good news, for I had
now been in the Army over a year. The battalion had
been recruited to full strength early in 1916, and I
had hoped to be in France before the end of that year.
It was now June, 1917.</p>

<p>The following morning I left Witley Camp for
London, where I was to receive further orders and
equip myself with bed-roll, trench boots, etc. At headquarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
in London, I learned that I was to go to
No. 2 Canadian Infantry Base Depot, at Etaples.
From there, after a while, I would be sent to the
trenches.</p>

<p>Etaples is a quaint little fishing village on the Canche
River, about two miles from its mouth. Before the
war it had been a famous resort for artists; quite a
colony had lived in the little town. Apart from its
quaintness and the picturesque costumes of the townsfolk,
its chief interest for artists lay in its beautiful
sunsets. It was a glorious sight to look down the
Canche, widening between the jack-pine-crested sand
dunes, as it flowed nearer the sea, to the great golden
sun sliding down towards the merry dancing blue
waves of the Straits of Dover, slowly turning red and
redder as it sank among the long pencils or banks of
reddening clouds fringed with gold. When the sun
would sink into the waves the water would be crimsoned
for miles, and for a long time after the great
red disc had disappeared the distant sails of the fishing
boats made a very pretty picture as they moved
silently over the waves.</p>

<p>Etaples, besides being quaint, was a very dirty little
town. At any hour of the day one might see a good
housewife come to the door and empty a tub of soapy
water that had served its use into the cobbled-street,
where it was mingled with other soapy waters that
ran continuously along the gutters. Every morning
piles of garbage appeared in the streets before the
houses.</p>

<p>During the war almost every house bore a sign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
nailed to the door upon which was written or printed
the word “Estaminet,” which signified that within
one might purchase wine, beer, coffee and other refreshments.
Sometimes accompanying the sign was a
smaller one, bearing the English words, “Eggs and
chips.”</p>

<p>All the narrow cobble-stoned streets that ran from
every direction into the village stopped at the large
market square. Market days were twice a week, and
then it was difficult to find one’s way through the
crowds who came to buy from the black- or white-hooded
country women, whose market wagons, mostly
drawn by donkeys, were laden with everything imaginable
from farm, house, and field. It was a striking
scene there in the old market square before the town
hall. Soldiers from almost all the Allied armies could
be seen there, while nurses from the great military
hospitals, about one-half mile from the town along
the road that followed the Canche towards Camiers
and the sea, moved quickly, nearly always two by two,
carrying small market-baskets.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">At No. 2 Canadian Infantry Base Depot</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>At the No. 2 Canadian Infantry Base Depot I had
the most wonderful opportunity of the war to study
the Catholics of the allied armies—Irish, Scotch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Welsh, English, New Zealand, Australian and Portuguese.
For here were depot camps for all these troops.
Often there would be as many as one hundred thousand
men training at one time, but after every engagement
drafts would be called for up the line. Then they
would be given their full equipment from the large
ordnance stores at Etaples, and in the evening they
would come to confession and Communion. There
were two large Catholic recreation huts, with a chapel
in each. On Sundays folding doors were opened and
the whole hut became a chapel; hundreds of soldiers
came to assist at the different Masses that were said
in each hut.</p>

<p>In the evening great numbers came to confession,
and always crowds assisted at the early week-day
morning Mass. Every evening priests would be on
duty in the little chapels hearing confessions and, if
soldiers had been called urgently and were leaving
for the front, giving Communion.</p>

<p>It was my lot for the most part to hear confessions
in the Catholic hut to which came not only my own
Canadian lads, but the Irish of the famous Sixteenth
Division: Connaughts, Leinsters, Munsters, Irish Guards,
etc. It was wonderfully edifying to sit evening after
evening and hear the confessions of these Irish lads.
They would usually begin by saying, “God bless you,
Father!” They came in extraordinarily large numbers
every night and always stayed a long while to
pray. The faith seemed to be part of their very being.
Though they did not parade it, these lads seemed
scarcely to breathe without showing in some way the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
love for their faith. When they met the Catholic
chaplain in the street, they did not give him the salute
they were supposed to give him, in common with
all other officers. They always took off their hats.
They were the only soldiers who ever did this. I
asked an Irish Catholic officer about it one evening.
“Why, Father,” he said, “they think the military
salute not good enough for a priest. It does all very
well, they think, for a general or a field marshal or
the King of England, but it’s not enough for a priest.
They must take their hats off, although they break a
military rule by so doing.” “God bless them,” I said
warmly.</p>

<p>The Queen of England visited the hospitals and
military depots of Etaples while I was there. Happening
to be near the Irish depot when she was about to
pass, I stood among the great crowds of soldiers that
lined each side of the road. In about three minutes
the Queen would come along. Suddenly I heard the
high, effeminate voice of an English officer of superior
rank calling out: “Tell that man to put on his coat.
See here, you!”</p>

<p>Looking in the direction towards which the colonel
called, I saw an Irish soldier, minus his tunic, go galloping
in his heavy military boots through a path that
widened accommodatingly for him and closed behind
him, so that progress was almost impossible for the
aristocratic colonel, who perhaps wished to identify
the man.</p>

<p>I remember one evening after I had finished confessions
in Oratory Hut and had come back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
tent in my own lines, finding a young Scotch officer
sitting at the little deal table waiting for me. After
talking for awhile, he told me that for some time he
had been wishing to become a Catholic, and that if
I could spare the time he would begin instructions
whenever I wished.</p>

<p>We began that night, and a few weeks later I baptized
him in the chapel of Oratory Hut. An Englishman—I
think his name was Edmund Hanley—stood
sponsor. During the ceremony the chaplain of the
Portuguese soldiers came in and knelt reverently.
When all was over and we had offered congratulations,
the Portuguese priest shook hands with the neophyte;
then he came over to me and gave me both his hands
warmly. Although he could not speak my language,
nor I his, still we were brother priests, and I was sure
he knew the joy I felt over this new sheep coming into
the fold of Christ.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The New Zealanders</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Of all the lads of different nationalities who visited
the little chapel in the evening and who came so
often to Holy Communion in the early morning, I
think I liked the best the New Zealanders. They were
nearly all tall, lithe men, dark-haired, with long, narrow
faces, and eyes that had a strange intensity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
expression: perhaps one might call them piercing.
They were quiet-voiced men and spoke with rather an
English accent. They were the gentlest, finest men
it was my good fortune to meet in the army. They
were excellent Catholics, many of them daily communicants.
The Maoris, the aborigines of New Zealand,
were treated by the white men with the same courtesy
that they showed one to another. The Maoris were
the most intelligent looking men of the yellow race I
had ever met. In fact, it was only by their color—which
was almost chocolate—that one could distinguish
them from the New Zealanders themselves.
Those of the Maoris who were Catholics were excellent
ones.</p>

<p>I recall one incident which impressed me very much
with New Zealand courtesy. I had come to a segregation
camp, just outside the little village of Etaples,
to arrange for the Sunday church parade of the soldiers
on the following day. The soldiers who were
quartered in the segregation camp were men who had
come in contact with those suffering from contagious
diseases. They usually stayed in this camp about
three weeks. If after this period no symptoms of any
contagious disease appeared they returned to their
different units. The day I speak of, three officers were
sitting in the mess when I went to announce the services,
two Englishmen and one New Zealander. I
told the officer in charge that I should like to have
the Catholic men paraded for Mass the following day,
suggesting to him to name the hour most suitable.
He, an Englishman, said eleven o’clock. I was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
to say, “Very well,” when the New Zealand officer
interposed gently but firmly. “You will have to make
the hour earlier than that, Captain,” he said. “You
know the Father will be fasting till after his Mass.”</p>

<p>The English officer looked at me quickly. “Why,
Padre,” he said, “it did not occur to me that you
would be fasting. Certainly, we’ll have it earlier.
How about nine o’clock?” Nine would suit perfectly,
I assured him. As I was to say an early Mass for the
nurses at 7:30, I would just have time to move my
altar to the dunes, where I was to celebrate Mass,
before the soldiers would arrive.</p>

<p>The Mass was finished very early that Sunday, and
there was no long fast. I was very grateful to the
New Zealander for his thoughtfulness. As I have said
before, they were the gentlest, finest men I had ever
met.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Workers</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>There was one thing about the natives of Etaples
that impressed me particularly, and that was the respect
each artisan seemed to have for his work. In
the little village were candle-makers, bakers, boot-makers,
makers of brushes, etc., and all these workmen
seemed to be interested in their work and to have a
great respect for it. They worked slowly, patiently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and always thoroughly. I noticed the same spirit in
the fields. Just beyond the hill and the giant windmill
that overlooked the village, unfenced green fields
sloped downward to green valleys, then up over the
hills again. Through this open countryside wound
the white roads of France; and always the great
main roads were arched by ancient elms. Unlike England,
not even a hedge divided the property of owners.
Here every day crowds of farm laborers, mostly
women and girls, came early to work. One noticed
a total absence of all modern farm implements. The
women still used the old-fashioned reaping hook that
was used long before the coming of Christ. What they
cut they bound carefully into tiny sheaves. The
women, for the most part, were dressed as the woman
in Millet’s picture, “The Angelus,” from hood to wooden
shoes. Here, again, the work was done patiently,
quietly, and thoroughly. The modern idea of saving
labor seemed never to have come to them. Sometimes
when not very busy I would take a walk through the
long white roads, leading into a white-housed red-roofed
village, the Norman tower of the little church
piercing the tree-tops; then out again through more
green unfenced fields to another little village two, or
three, or sometimes four miles away.</p>

<p>Often while on these walks, I used to think of the
rugged strength of these sturdy French peasants who
went so steadily and quietly about their work. They
were strongly built people, well developed, and their
faces were deep red—I suppose from so much work
out of doors.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXVI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Orders Again</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had come down to my tent one evening a little
later than usual to find a D. R. L. S. letter from the
Chaplain Service awaiting me. D. R. L. S. meant
“Dispatch Riders’ Letter Service.” I opened it quickly,
as a letter from headquarters, brought by a dispatch
rider, might contain very important orders.
This was an order to report for duty at No. 7 Canadian
General Hospital the following day.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It was nearly nine o’clock.
It was very dark outside and the rain was beating on
my tent. No. 7 was at least two miles distant, but I
must see the chaplain before he would leave. I put
on my trench coat and stepped out into the rain.</p>

<p>As I drew near the hospital I was obliged to pass
by a German prison camp. I suppose my thoughts
were wandering that night. At least the first thing
I realized was seeing through the rain the bright blade
of a bayonet thrust at my breast; then I heard the
voice of the guard: “Quick! Are you friend?”</p>

<p>I stopped suddenly. I had not heard him challenge
me the first time, which he surely must have done. I
realized in an instant my position. “Yes,” I shouted,
“friend.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good job you spoke, sir,” warned the guard,
and then he said, quickly, “Pass, friend.”</p>

<p>Although I had realized my position, I had not felt
the slightest alarm, but now as I walked along in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
darkness a strange fear took possession of me, so that
I shook almost violently. I have been challenged often
by sentries since that night, but it has never been
necessary to inquire more than once; nor have I ever
been halted so suddenly by a pointed bayonet.</p>

<p>I found the out-going chaplain, Father Coté, packing
his bed-roll, and as he packed he gave me all the advice
necessary to an incoming chaplain. The following
morning he went up the line, and immediately
after lunch I left No. 2 C. I. B. D., where I had been
most cordially treated by both officers and men, and
came to No. 7 Canadian General Hospital.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Hospitals and Trains</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>No. 7 Canadian General was only one of a group of
hospitals situated along the highway that led from
Etaples to Camiers. There were seven or eight large
hospitals in all, though only two were Canadian, the
others being British. Although I was quartered at
No. 7, I had also to attend the other Canadian Hospital,
No. 1. There were about 2,500 beds in No. 7, and
about 2,000 in No. 1.</p>

<p>At one end of No. 1, there was a marquee chapel-tent
and at the rear of No. 7 there was a low wooden
chapel called “Church of Our Lady, Help of Christians,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
but this was used mostly by the British Catholics.</p>

<p>The military hospital in France usually consisted
of a number of long, low, detached one-story huts,
built in rows, each row behind the other. Between
the rows ran little lanes just wide enough to permit
two ambulances to pass. There was a door in each end
of every hut, so that it was very easy to go from one
hut into the other. Each hut was a ward; in some
hospitals they were numbered; in others they were
lettered. Down each side of the aisle, running from
door to door, was a row of beds—low iron beds covered
with army blankets. In most of the hospitals
there were no counterpanes, but there were always
clean white sheets and pillow-cases. At one end of
the ward were two small cubicles, one of which was
the nurses’ office, the other a kind of pantry and
emergency kitchen, though nearly all the cooking was
done in the general kitchen, which was a special hut.</p>

<p>Into these large, quiet wards, far away from the
roar of the heavy guns, the crackle of machine-guns
and rifles, the wounded lads came, carried by train
and ambulance.</p>

<p>Many who will read these lines have seen the troop-trains,
with their hundreds of khaki-clad lads leaning
out from car windows, cheering, singing, and waving,
as they were carried swiftly by on their way to seaport
or training-camp. Perhaps they have watched
long companies of soldier boys march up dusty roads,
while flags waved and bands played and people
cheered, to the lines of cars waiting for them. If so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
they will recall the great buoyancy of the lads—their
gaiety as they passed on their way to training-camp
or port of embarkation for overseas.</p>

<p>This light-heartedness accompanied them across the
sea and went with them up through France as they
journeyed in other troop-trains to the front. And
whenever thirsty engines stopped at watertanks, or
when a halt was made to exchange a tired engine,
little French children assembled and gazed wide-eyed
at the soldiers who had come from across the seas.
They wondered, too, what those words meant that
some one on the troop-trains always called out and
which brought such a thundering response. Many
trains went up along the same way through France
and stopped, as others had stopped, and always some
voice called out those words, and always hundreds of
voices roared back, “No!” So in time the French
children learned them, and whenever the trains slowed
into a station the little ones would run to the cars,
and one of their number would call out, “Har we doon-hearted?”
Then, mingled with the laughter of the
khaki-clad lads, would come thundering the answer,
“No!”</p>

<p>After awhile trains bearing soldiers began to come
down from the line. But when the engines stopped at
watering-tanks or stations the little French children
that gathered about them noticed certain differences
between these trains and the ones that went up to the
front. Everything seemed very silent, save for the
slow panting of the engine. On the side of every car
was painted, in the middle of a large white circle, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
red cross. No groups of laughing faces appeared at
open car windows; though now and again the white,
drawn face of some one lying in a berth peered out
through the glass. Sometimes a white bandage was
tied around the head, and sometimes on the white
bandage was a dark-red patch. No one called out,
“Are we downhearted?”</p>

<p>Trains kept coming down from the front somewhat
irregularly; silent trains with red crosses painted on
white circles on the sides of the cars. Then one day
there was a slight change in the appearance of these
hospital trains. The red cross was still there, but
painted near one end, on the side of the car, was an
oblong of red, white and blue about three feet long
and two wide. The little children knew well what this
was—the tricolor of France. But they did not know
what the oblong of red, white and blue painted on the
side, at the other end of the car, represented. The
disposition of the color was different, and the formation
of the colored parts was not the same. There
were more stripes in this oblong, and the stripes were
narrower and red and white in color. In the upper
corner was a small blue square with many white stars
on it. Then one day some one told the little children
that this was the flag of the Americans who had come
from so far across the seas to help their fathers and
brothers in the war.</p>

<p>As I write these words I recall the passing of the
trains of France. Those that went up took light-hearted
lads who leaned from car windows and sang
and cheered as they went through French villages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
And the trains that came down, with red crosses on
them, had for their passengers quiet lads who lay in
berths, bandaged in every conceivable way. But although
they suffered much, and although occasionally
a low moan escaped through pain-drawn lips, those
wonderful lads were still “not downhearted.”</p>

<p>They passed through many different hands after
they were wounded and always they were well treated.
First, stretcher-bearers picked them up and carried
them to the regimental aid post, which was usually a
dugout in one of the support trenches. Here they received
treatment from the medical officer of the battalion
and his staff. Then they were carried by other
stretcher-bearers down the trenches to the field station,
from which places motor ambulances took them
to the advanced dressing station where bandages were
re-arranged or improved. Then they went to the clearing
station, where they remained for perhaps two or
three days until there was a clearing for the hospital
to which they were to go.</p>

<p>Ambulances took them to the Red Cross trains and
stretcher-bearers carried them gently to berths in the
cars, and then they began their long journey to the
base hospital—the big quiet hospital far away from
the roar of the guns. From time to time medical officers
passed down the aisle of the car, and sometimes
a Red Cross nurse, clad in light grey uniform, gave
medicine to the wounded lads or examined a dressing.</p>

<p>The journey from the casualty clearing station to
the base hospital often took many hours. It was usually
evening when the long line of Red Cross cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
came slowly into the smooth siding that had been built
since the war. The bugle call would sound and many
hospital orderlies and stretcher-bearers would assemble,
as, one after another, the big green ambulances,
each one driven by a woman, came swiftly down to
the siding. Gradually their speed slackened, and they
moved slowly down the line of hospital cars, in the
sides of which doors opened. Then gently and carefully
the wounded lads, wrapped in thick brown army
blankets and lying on stretchers, were lowered from
the cars and carried to the open ends of the ambulances,
where the stretchers were fitted into racks
running their full length—two above and two below.
As soon as the stretchers were securely strapped the
machine slowly moved off to the hospital, which was
just a few hundred yards away.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">D I’s and S I’s</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I remember the day I arrived at No. 7. The quartermaster
allotted me a burlap hut in the officers’ lines,
just large enough to contain a low iron bed, a rough
table, made of boards from an old packing case, a
chair (which was not there) and a little stove when
it was cold enough for one. I hung my trench coat on
a nail and asked the two men who had brought my bed-roll
to place it where the chair should have been. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
gave just one look around the hut, then went out again
and up to the Registrar’s office, first to No. 1, then
back to No. 7.</p>

<p>Every morning a list was posted outside the Registrar’s
offices, on which were printed the names of the
D. I.’s and S. I.’s; those Dangerously Ill and Seriously
Ill. For obvious reasons the Catholics of both classes
were always prepared for death immediately. I found
a number of Catholics in a critical condition and I
administered the last sacraments to them. It was
long after six o’clock when I finished my work. I
was leaving No. 7 feeling a little tired, for I had
covered quite a lot of ground on my visits, when I
heard “Padre” called by one of the nurses, who was
coming quickly behind me.</p>

<p>I stopped until she came to where I was standing.
She asked me if I were the new R. C. chaplain. On
being answered in the affirmative she told me she had
a list of men of my faith who should be seen by their
chaplain immediately. She passed me her list as she
spoke, and in a second or two I was comparing it with
the names written in the little black book that I had
taken from the left upper pocket of my tunic. I had
seen them all: all had been “housled and aneled,” had
been prepared to meet God. I told her so, quietly,
and I showed her my little book.</p>

<p>She compared the names: then she looked at me
keenly. “My!” she said, “how you Catholic priests
look after your men!” Then she was gone again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Down the Hospital Aisle</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although the emergency cases were attended at all
hours by the chaplain, it was in the afternoon that
the general visiting was done. Each patient, when
he had entered the hospital, had attached to the buttonhole
of his shirt, or overcoat if he was wearing it,
a thick waterproof envelope containing a card on
which was written a description of the wounds he had
received and the treatment that had been given them
in the different stations through which he had passed.
Sometimes, though not often, there was a smaller card
attached to the large one—but we shall speak of this
card later. The nurse in charge of the ward kept the
cards of her patients in her office. As the religious
denomination of the patient was always given on his
card, together with the number of his bed, it was very
easy for me to find my patients once I had written
down the names from the cards.</p>

<p>The first question that I usually asked the men, after
I had inquired about their wounds, was how long it
was since they were at Communion. Nearly always it
was a few days or a week, as most of them had gone
to Holy Communion before going into the trenches,
though sometimes it was a month or two; and sometimes
a man looked up at me steadily and said, “Ten
years, Father,” or perhaps fifteen, or perhaps more.
Then I would say, quietly: “It will soon be time to
go again, won’t it?” Usually the man smiled, but generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
he agreed with me. When I would meet a man
a long time away, I would make a note in my little
book so that I might make some special visits to him.
Often, I had the great joy of seeing men, a long time
away from the sacraments, return to God.</p>

<p>One afternoon I stopped at the bed of a bright-eyed
young Canadian whose face lit up on seeing me,
for he knew I was the priest. He had lost one of his
arms above the elbow, so I began to talk to him of
the wonderful artificial limbs that were being made for
those disabled in the war.</p>

<p>The lad just smiled quietly—he was not the least
bit downhearted—as he said: “They can’t help me
much in my line, Father.” Then he fumbled with
his hand in the little bag in the small white locker
that had been placed near his bed, and when he found
his pay-book he asked me to open it and read the newspaper
clipping that was there. The head-line said,
“Pat Rafferty Enlists,” and underneath, in smaller
print, was a second heading: “Champion Light Weight
Boxer of Western Canada Goes to the Front with the ——
Battalion.” Then there were two short paragraphs,
and below them was a picture of a young man
in civilian dress. I examined it a moment, and as I
looked at the original I felt a wave of pity well up
within me. Yet the brave young soldier smiled.</p>

<p>It was not only Canadian soldiers who came to the
hospital, for men of all the English-speaking armies
were brought there. I always enjoyed a talk with the
Irish wounded; they had such a warm friendliness and
reverence for the priest. It really was not necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
for me to procure the number of their beds, once these
men knew that it was the priest who was coming
down the aisle, for I could have found them by the
eager, smiling faces that watched me as I came. They
always got in the first word; before I quite reached
their beds I would hear their truly Irish greeting,
“God bless you, Father,” and then as I would shake
hands, they would ask me eagerly how I was—I had
come to see how they were. They always wanted a
medal—they pronounced it more like “middle”—and
it was a little one that they wanted. One day I
spread out on the palm of my hand eight medals of
assorted sizes, and told a great giant to help himself.
Among the medals was the tiniest one I have ever
seen. The great finger and thumb did not hesitate
for a second, but groped twice unsuccessfully for the
tiny medal; finally, the third time they bore it away,
while over the large face of the Irish lad spread the
delighted smile of a child.</p>

<p>When I asked one of these lads which battalion he
was in, expecting of course to be told the First or Second
Munsters, or Leinsters, or Dublins, etc., but that is
what I never heard. This is what they would say:
“Father Doyle’s, Father,” or “Father Gleason’s,
Father,” or “Father Maloney’s, Father.”</p>

<p>One afternoon, just when I entered, my eyes fell
on a bright face looking up over the blankets. I knew
he was a Catholic, an Irishman, from the Munster
Fusiliers, though I judged from the manner in which
the large blue eyes regarded me that he was not so
sure about my religion. I thought that there was also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
a hint of battle in the glint of his eye, so I walked
quickly over to his bed, without the faintest flicker of
a smile, and said: “Let me see now, you’re a Baptist,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>The blue eyes of the Munster lad blazed as he looked
up at me. “No, sir, I’m not! I’m a Roman Catholic!”
he said, and as he panted for breath, I said to him
quietly: “Well, now, I’m glad to hear that. I’m a
Roman Catholic, too!”</p>

<p>Then swiftly the vindictive look faded out of the
blue eyes of the Irish lad and a smile floated over his
face as he said, somewhat shamefacedly: “Excuse me,
Father—I didn’t know, Father—I’m glad to see you,
Father,” (pronouncing the “a” in Father like the
“a” in Pat), and a big red, brown-freckled hand was
shyly offered me. It was only three days since Father
Gleason gave him and all his comrades Holy Communion,
but he would be pleased, if it would not be too
much trouble to His Reverence, to go again in the morning.
I wrote his name in the little book and promised
to come in the morning with the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Two Brothers</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had been visiting the two brothers for over a
week—indeed one of them for over two weeks, before
I knew they were brothers. One was in No. 1<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
hospital; the other in No. 7: one had been wounded in
the chest or shoulder; the other in the knee. I carried
messages one to the other, and they looked forward
eagerly to my coming, for it was three years
since they had seen each other. They used to anticipate
with great pleasure the day when they would be
convalescent and could see each other. Then one
evening the lad who was wounded in the knee told me
that the following morning there was to be an evacuation
for England and that he was among the number.
Although he was glad to hear this good news, still
he regretted very much not being able to see his brother
before leaving. “It is so long since I’ve seen
him, Father, and he is so near,” he said wistfully.</p>

<p>I looked at the young fellow for a few moments,
wondering silently what I could do to bring about a
meeting of the brothers. First, I thought I might obtain
permission for the ambulance to stop at No. 1 on
its way to the siding, and that the young fellow might
be carried in on a stretcher. But on second thought
I felt it would be very difficult to obtain such a permission.
Finally, I decided to ask the adjutant for
permission to have him taken up to No. 1 on a wheel
stretcher. The adjutant was very kind, granting my
request. That evening the two brothers met for the
first time in three years and passed two hours together.</p>

<p>This little act of kindness did not pass unnoticed,
for I learned afterwards that it had met with the warm
approval of many in both hospitals—I suppose because
it was just one of those little human touches that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
everybody loves. But I could not help thinking of the
numerous other meetings in the early morning, or often
at any hour of the day or night, when through my
ministrations two others were brought together, sometimes
after a much longer separation than that of the
brothers. One would be some poor broken lad who
sometimes was a little bashful or shy about the meeting;
the other was Jesus of Nazareth, the Saviour of
the world. Not many concerned themselves about
these meetings, but—there was “joy among the
angels.”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">An Unexpected Turning</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was now November. The days were passing very
quickly for I was kept busy; convoys were coming
daily. Passchendael was being fought. I had to visit
the D. I.’s and S. I.’s very often, for many were being
admitted. One morning I stopped just long enough to
prepare an Australian for death. He had been wounded
through the throat and could not swallow, so that
it was impossible for me to give him Holy Communion.
I absolved him and anointed him quickly, then I
told him I must pass on as I had many more to visit.
It was almost impossible for him to speak, and he
did so with great pain, but as he gave me his hand and
his dying eyes looked at me, he made a great effort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
“Cheerio,” he whispered. Truly these wonderful lads
were not downhearted!</p>

<p>During the month of November thousands of patients
passed through the hospital. Everybody was
working extremely hard. Sometimes during the night,
convoys arrived. The anaesthetist, who sat next me
at mess, told me that he was beginning to feel that he
could not continue very much longer; for days he had
been giving chloroform almost steadily, as there were
very many operations. We were both longing for a
little lull in the work so that we might get a few hours’
rest.</p>

<p>There were many places where the officers of the
hospitals used to go. There was “The Blue Cat” at
Paris Plage, a famous seaside resort about three miles
from Etaples, where they went to have tea and bathe
in the sea. There was the village of Frencq, where a
little old lady kept a small coffee house and made
omelettes that were famous. Then there were two
officers’ clubs and an officers’ circulating library at
Etaples. I had been to the library at different times
while at the base. There was a large reading-room exceptionally
well lighted, for it was a part of an old
studio. Tea was served every afternoon from 3:30 to
6:00 o’clock, at which a number of old English officers
assembled. It was very amusing to listen to them relating
past experiences, in which often a good dinner
was not forgotten. They treated the soldier-waiter
as if he were one of their own personal servants, calling
him often; and although there was but one syllable
in his name (it was Brown) they managed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
twist the last letter into a rather complaining inflection.
I watched Brown a number of times, and although
he came “on the double” and stood head erect,
looking at his nose, as all good butlers do, still I
thought I detected on more than one occasion a merry
light in his bright brown eyes, and he seemed to be
exerting a little extra will power in keeping his lips
composed.</p>

<p>Then one day there came a lull in the rush of work,
and being advised by one of the officers to take a little
recreation, I obeyed.</p>

<p>I recall that afternoon particularly. I went to the
officers’ circulating library, which was at the rear of
the town hall, where I passed the afternoon very pleasantly
looking through a delightfully illustrated edition
of “Our Sentimental Garden,” by Agnes and Egerton
Castle, whose home I had visited while at Bramshott.
The quarto volume contained many drawings of their
pretty garden from different angles. It was very restful
sitting in the quaint old studio, through the great
windowed wall of which streamed the autumn sunlight.</p>

<p>Towards five o’clock tea was served by my old
friend, the butler humorist. Then as the sun went
quietly down into the sea, far out, I walked back to
No. 7, feeling very much benefited by my visit, meeting
hundreds of soldiers, nurses and civilians on the
way.</p>

<p>It was dusk when I entered my little burlap hut. I
lit the lamp, and as I did, the light flashed over an
open letter on my newspaper-covered desk. All the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
feeling of exhilaration which had cheered my return
walk left me suddenly, and an overwhelming, foreboding
cloud came over my spirits; for the letter said:
“Please come quickly, Padre, there is one of your men
dying in Ward 3, bed 17.” It was signed by the adjutant
of No. 1 hospital, and the hour of the day was
marked on the letter. It had been sent at 2:30. It
was now 6:00 p. m. I turned down the lamp and went
quickly out of the little hut praying, as I ran up the
road, that the lad might be still alive. I walked down
the ward, not noticing the friendly faces that turned
to greet me, as was their custom. The red screens were
around the bed. I moved them gently and stood quietly
by the lad’s bed. An orderly moved a little to one
side.</p>

<p>“He’s dead, sir,” said the orderly. “Died just a
minute ago.”</p>

<p>I put on my purple stole, gave the lad conditional
absolution and anointed him conditionally. Then I
stood for a long while looking on his still white face,
wishing with all my heart that I had not left the hospital
that day. Then the orderly made a little movement
and I turned and went down the aisle of the
ward, repressing a great desire to burst into tears; it
was the first time, through my neglect, that I had ever
missed a call to the dying. In passing I talked to a
few patients, but there seemed to be a strange numbness
in my brain, so that I did not follow the words
spoken by the occupants of different beds where I
stopped; one or two ceased speaking and looked at
me keenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Just as I was about to leave the ward little Sister
Daughney came in. She stopped and spoke to me,
and her words were as sweetest music to my ear.</p>

<p>“Ah, Father,” she said—Sister was from Ireland—“I
sent for you this afternoon for the lad who has
just died. He would have been glad to see you, Father,
although there was no need; for he said he had been
anointed and prepared for death just six hours before
up in the C. C. S.”</p>

<p>I looked at the little sister talking so quietly and in
such a matter-of-fact way: while thundering in my ears
was the desire to break forth into a great <i>Te Deum
Laudamus</i>. She spoke to me of two or three new patients
who might develop more serious symptoms, then
passed on to other duties, whilst I went up the lane to
my little marquee chapel to kneel before the tabernacle
and make known to God my fervent gratitude. And
so, after all, I had passed a very pleasant day.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXXII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Private Belair</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The days passed quickly, for they were well filled,
and sometimes at night the call would come; my door
would open quite abruptly, awakening me, and the
light from a small flash-light would dazzle my surprised
eyes, while a voice called, “R. C. chaplain?” I recall
one night in particular. I had been awakened by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
orderly calling, to find him standing at the head of
my bed, his flash-light focused on a message written on
white interlined paper that he held before my eyes.
The words read: “Come quickly, Father, Wd 14, bed
7, Belair, gassed.” It was signed Sister Kirky, who
weighed almost 300 pounds. In twelve minutes I was
dressed and standing in the ward by Private Belair.
I was a little surprised to find him sitting up with just
his tunic and boots removed. He sat in such a way
that his arms rested over the back of his chair which
he faced. He was panting terribly and was evidently
suffering greatly. Every little while, when he seemed
to have sufficient strength, he would begin to pray in
whispered Latin, “O bone Jesu,” then his voice would
die out in a trembling whisper and the prayer would
become inaudible.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father,” he whispered, “I am—so glad—you
came. All my life—I have prayed—to have the
grace.” Then he began to pray again, and I made
ready to hear his confession. It did not take long for
it cost him terrible agony to speak. Then I anointed
him. I had not brought Holy Communion, being so
eager to reach him that I had not taken time to go
up to the chapel called “Church of Our Lady, Help
of Christians.” My own marquee chapel had blown
down a few days previous and I had removed the
Blessed Sacrament to the above-mentioned church. I
told the sick man I was going to bring our Blessed
Lord, but that it might take a little while, as very likely
I should find the church locked and should have to find
the key.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Although the ward had been but dimly-lighted it
was extremely dark on coming out, for it was raining;
and in my haste I tripped over a tent guy-rope, taut
by the rain, and fell on my hands and knees on the
cinder walk. Then I walked on more carefully, rubbing
tiny particles of cinders from my stinging hands.
Just as I reached the chapel I was challenged by the
guard. This time I answered quickly: “Friend. R. C.
chaplain No. 7. Can. Gen. Hospital.” I stood to be
recognized. Then the guard spoke, but this time softly,
and he peered at my rain-wet face. “Ah, Father,” he
said, “it’s you!” It was one of the Irish lads from the
Sixteenth Infantry Base Depot who was one of the
guards for the German prison camp opposite. He may
have seen me saying Mass at Oratory Hut, or perhaps
he had spent a few days at the segregation camp.</p>

<p>The door of the little church was locked, and I did
not know where to find the key. I knew that an English
Redemptorist, Father Prime, chaplain to No. 26
British General Hospital, said Mass here every morning;
perhaps he might know where the key was kept.
It was half a mile to Father Prime’s little hut at No.
26, and I went very quickly, praying all the while for
the poor gassed soldier that he might have the great
privilege for which he had prayed so much.</p>

<p>Father Prime was very easily awakened and seemed
glad that it was not a call for him to go out in the
rain. He had the key, and presently I was hurrying
back to the little church.</p>

<p>The Irish lad, still on guard, as I returned bearing
the Bread of Life to the dying soldier in the hospital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
knelt on the rainy ground, and I could just tell that
he was bowing his head as the Saviour passed.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was still alive, though panting in
great pain. He received Holy Communion most devoutly.
I felt that I was in the presence of an exceptionally
good man. In the afternoon he died.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXXIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Little Nonsense</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was hard work visiting the wounded, listening
time after time to each one as he described the nature
and history of his wounds, which in many cases were
so similar. Often on leaving one hut only to enter another,
I have paused to look longingly out to the estuary
of the Canche, where the sun would be sinking
slowly, and breathe the strong, aromatic air coming
from the sea and the marshes that grew from the river
mud; then in again to great wards of poor broken
lads and the antiseptic odors of the hospital.</p>

<p>Although the spirits of the lads, on the whole, were
bright and merry, and those who nursed them brought
sunshine to their work, still one would scarcely think
of entering any one ward with the intention of being
entertained. Yet frequently I have gone into a certain
ward of No. 7, Canadian General, with no other intention
than that of being amused. For in this ward were
the malingerers, that is, the men who were trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
“put one over” on the doctors. The soldiers called
them “lead swingers.” The ingenuity of some of these
men was really extraordinary. I have seen a case come
through three or four different posts, diagnosed as
measles, until finally the doctor in the stationary hospital
saw that the man had used a preparation of some
oil to bring out the rash, and had raised his temperature
with cordite.</p>

<p>The first day I went into Wd. —, I was somewhat
puzzled. I had not known that this was the ward of
malingerers, and so was surprised to find so many
healthy looking men in hospital. The nurse in charge
looked a little surprised when I entered and said smilingly:
“Well, Padre, what are you doing here? Nobody
ever dies in this ward.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sister,” I said, “as far as I can see now,
every one has the appearance of being quite spruce.”
Then she said quietly: “P. U. O.,” nodding her head
a little after pronouncing each letter. Then she went
into her cubicle to continue her work.</p>

<p>That evening at dinner I asked the doctor who sat
nearest me what was meant by “P. U. O.” He smiled,
then said: “It means, Padre, ‘Praxis of Unknown Origin’,”
and kept smiling as he continued: “We sometimes
meet a case which really puzzles us, but nearly
always, when you see ‘P. U. O.’ on a medical history
sheet you can count on its being a case of malingering.”
He did not say very much till we had nearly
finished our meal, then he said: “Wait, Padre, after
dinner and we’ll see ‘Boots’.”</p>

<p>This was a nickname for the doctor in charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Ward —, one of the jolliest M. O.’s in the mess. We
found him in the ante-room, three or four others
grouped around him; but instead of the customary
broad smile on his good-natured fat face, there was a
look of real indignation. He was explaining to his
smiling listeners something about a few cases that had
been sent to him; and as we drew near I caught these
words: “Dey had da hitch,”—the doctor was a
French Canadian—“and dey were sent to my ward—height
of dem! Sent to me, and dem wit da hitch!”
Every one was laughing and trying unsuccessfully to
suppress it.</p>

<p>Then a young doctor interposed: “And what did
you do, Boots?”</p>

<p>“Do?” echoed the other. “What did I do? I just
took dare papers and sent dem up to the skin disease
hospital. Dere’s no room for men wit da hitch in my
ward.”</p>

<p>The mere thought of the indignity seemed almost too
much for the good doctor, so he paused for a little and
his face grew red as he looked around on his smiling
audience. Then he said: “Da idea of sending men wit
da hitch to me!” He had closed his lips tightly and
was nodding to himself at the insult that had been
offered his ward by having men with the itch sent to
it, when the doctor who had spoken previously spoke
again: “Yes, ‘Boots,’ the idea of sending sick men to
your ward!”</p>

<p>“Boots” looked at him quickly, and suddenly the
dark clouds were dispersed and the light of his broad,
sunny smile spread over his good-natured face. “Dat’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
hit,” he said. “What do dey want to send sick people
to me for?”</p>

<p>The others laughed and moved on, and presently I
found myself making arrangements with Captain
“Boots” to visit his ward when his “patients” would
be undergoing treatment the following morning. The
only condition the good doctor imposed was that I
would not laugh. This I promised.</p>

<p>The following day, as I walked down the aisle of No.
—, I realized how hard it would be to fulfill the condition
the doctor had made for my visit. The men were
undergoing “treatment”; some held the handles of a
galvanic battery in their hands, while their bodies
squirmed and twisted, but never for one instant did
they drop the handles; others had their feet on steel
discs in tubs of water, while others underwent electrical
treatment in different ways. The doctor moved
from bed to bed, inquiring with simulated solicitude as
to the state of each patient, offering a word of encouragement
to some poor fellow who writhed under
the current that passed through hands and feet.</p>

<p>“Dat’s right, my lad,” the doctor would say encouragingly,
“just keep your feet on de disc.” Perhaps
it did not occur to the good doctor that the man
was powerless to take his feet off the disc! To another
he would say: “Dere, now, my lad, we’ll soon have
you in perfec health again”—and I would wonder how
the strong, rosy-cheeked lad would look when in perfect
health.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to hear two or three lads inform
the doctor that they thought they felt well enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
go back to their battalions again. The doctor would
always agree with them. One fellow said, within my
hearing: “He might as well give us the chair at once!”</p>

<p>I remember coming out of the ward that first day,
and when I was out of view, I stood in the lane and
laughed and laughed. The fat doctor had been so
funny, and also the poor fellows, squirming and twisting
under treatment that was not at all necessary for
them.</p>

<p>I made many subsequent visits to No. —. Whenever
I would feel tired out from the more serious work
of visiting the wounded, I would step down the lane
and listen for awhile to Doctor “Boots” passing up
and down the aisle giving his electrical treatment.</p>

<p>Although the little wooden chapel called Church of
Our Lady, Help of Christians was nearer No. 7, I
always said Mass in the chapel at No. 1. It was wonderfully
edifying there in that little marquee chapel.
I don’t know who had had it erected, for it was standing
when I went to No. 1, but I do recall the devout
congregations of walking wounded in their hospital
suits of light-blue fleeced wool; the hospital orderlies
who came so reverently; the white-veiled blue-clad
nurses who came in large numbers. Two Masses were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
said on Sunday so as to accommodate the different
shifts of Sisters, and every Sunday evening there was
Benediction and a short sermon.</p>

<p>I remember one morning noticing that the hospital
orderly who served the Mass trembled while answering
the opening responses. He was a tall, well-built
young fellow with light hair, and usually his face had
the glow of excellent health; but when he passed me
the cruets, I noticed that his face had almost the pallor
of death, and that although it was a cold morning in
early autumn little beads of perspiration stood out on
his white forehead.</p>

<p>After Mass I asked him if he were not well. Then
he told me quietly that he felt extremely weak, having
given a quantity of his blood just a few days before
to save the life of a wounded soldier who was dying
from loss of blood. The wounded man was now
recovering. It was not the first time he had given his
blood, and, he said, as he smiled painfully and with
the appearance of great weakness, he felt that it
would not be the last time.</p>

<p>As he moved about slowly and wearily, extinguishing
the candles and covering the altar, I felt a great
admiration for this generous lad, and I thought truly
there are other heroic ways of giving one’s blood than
shedding it on the battlefield! It was quite a common
occurrence in different hospitals to go through the
process of transfusion of blood. The most necessary
condition was that the blood of the donor be adaptable
to the system of the patient.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Ministering Angels</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The nurses—“sisters” we called them—throughout
all the base hospitals were most attentive to the
wounded, without the slightest display of any maudlin
sympathy; but they worked hard and long and one
never heard the least complaint from their lips. It
was a common occurrence at No. 7 to see a nurse being
ordered away for a complete rest, made necessary
by the terrific strain of her work.</p>

<p>The Catholic nurses were, on the whole, very faithful
in the practice of their religious duties, many being
weekly communicants. To communicate daily was not
practicable for many, as they were on duty during
morning Mass. Often I have seen a nurse come with
five or six of her patients to Holy Communion: some
back-sliders that she had rounded up.</p>

<p>Often, while giving Holy Communion to a soldier in
the ward of a non-Catholic nurse, I had been annoyed
by the lack of any special preparations on the part of
the sister for the administration of the Sacrament.
But one morning I found a spotlessly white cloth spread
over the small locker, a clean graduate glass of fresh
water and a spoon. There was also on the locker a
folded white towel for the lad to hold when receiving
Holy Communion.</p>

<p>It pleased me very much to see such care taken to
prepare for the coming of Jesus, and it was with deep
gratitude that I went to thank the sister in charge,
after I had given the lad Holy Communion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Sister,” I said, “how did you know how to prepare
everything so well? It was so clean, and everything
necessary was there.”</p>

<p>The good little sister seemed pleased that I had even
noticed the preparations. Then she said: “Well,
Padre, I knew just what was needed for I studied nursing
in a Catholic hospital.”</p>

<p>As I went out of the ward the thought struck me
how fine it would be if only all the non-Catholic sisters
would prepare for the Saviour’s coming as had their
sister nurse, and as I thought I formed a little plan.</p>

<p>The following day I was notified by a non-Catholic
sister to bring Communion to a boy in her ward; and
there and then I tried out my plan. “Sister,” I said,
“yesterday morning I was called to Sister ——’s
ward to administer one of my lads who is dangerously
ill, and I was very much surprised to find the table
arranged as if it had been done by an R. C. Sister.”</p>

<p>“How did she have it arranged, Padre?” she asked.
Then I told her just how things had been prepared.
The following morning when I brought the “Bread of
the Strong” to the poor wounded lad, I found, as on
the previous day, everything spotlessly arranged for
the visit of the Guest.</p>

<p>After that, whenever a non-Catholic sister told me
that a Catholic lad had need of my ministrations in
her ward, I told her how well the last sister had prepared
locker, etc., and invariably the following morning,
when I went in silence to the bedside, I found that
all things had been made ready.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">More Orders</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>December came. During the first week of that
month I prepared my hut to stand the cold of the
winter months and began to look forward to a time
of relative repose after the past five months of strenuous
work. The fighting was not to be so intense
during the winter, therefore there would not be so
many casualties. I had been given a fine little coal
stove, and I was beginning to enjoy coming into the
hut at night to be greeted by its cheerful red glow.
There were worse places to dwell in, I told myself,
than a burlap hut with a coal fire burning in it. I
was looking forward to peaceful winter evenings with
books to read, or perhaps a few hours writing, when
one evening just before dinner a knock sounded on
the door and an officer stepped into my hut. I had
never seen him before. He looked at me somewhat
strangely for a second or two, then asked if I had not
been expecting him, “for,” he said, “I am Captain
Hawke, the new R. C. chaplain to No. 7 Canadian
General Hospital. You are to go up the line.”</p>

<p>For just a second a faint dizziness came over me,
and the vision of bright coal fires faded from before
my mind and I thought, with considerable falling of
spirits, of winter in the trenches.</p>

<p>I shook hands with the new chaplain and then I
told him I had not been expecting him, and that so far
no orders had come to me to report at the front. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
as I spoke, however, another knock sounded on the
door, and before I had time to open it an orderly entered
and passed me a D. R. L. S. letter: I was to
report at the Seventy-fifth Battalion the following
day.</p>

<p>So on the morning of December 11th, 1917, I left
No. 7 with real regret. I had always found the doctors
very friendly and they had shown me many kindnesses.
I had grown to love my work in the hospital,
and the peace and quiet of the little marquee chapel
at No. 1 Can. Gen. after the day’s work was done.
Now, I must break new ground!</p>

<p>It was a cold morning when I took my place on
the seat of the ambulance alongside the driver. The
waiters crowded about the door of the mess—the
doctors had not yet come from their huts—and one
of them, an old Scotchman wearing a glengarry, who
had already seen service up the line, stepped forward
and patted me on the back and wished me “guid
luck.” Then the ambulance leaped into high gear
and we were off to the station.</p>

<p>There were certain formalities to be gone through
at the military station at Etaples: certain papers had
to be shown to the R. T. O. and instructions received
from him. It did not take long to give my instructions.
I was to take the train on No. 9 track. I was
to detrain at Calonne-Ricouart; there I would receive
further instructions.</p>

<p>There was a great crowd of troopers on my train
who leaned from car windows and sang merrily as
the train passed through French villages. Then, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
remember, as we stopped at one village, I heard in the
distance the sound of the guns, and always as we advanced
came clearer and clearer the deep booming.
For the first time I heard sounds of the actual conflict
of the World War.</p>

<p>An officer whom I had met on the train accompanied
me to the staging camp, which was but a short distance
from the station at Calonne-Ricouart. I presented
my papers at the little office. The orderly
room clerk looked at me quickly. “Why, sir,” he
said, “you’re in luck! The Seventy-fifth Battalion is
just a few yards up the road. Better stay here for
lunch, then I’ll send a runner with you.”</p>

<p>I may have been lucky in finding the Seventy-fifth
but there my luck ended for a few days: for when I
entered headquarters of the Seventy-fifth, which was
in an old chateau, I was told that there had been
some mistake. They had a chaplain, a Presbyterian,
who was then away on leave. The R. C. chaplain of
the brigade was quartered with the Eighty-seventh.
The adjutant treated me politely, but with a little suspicion.
He asked me for my papers. Then he requested
me to be seated. I did so, but with a feeling
of vague uneasiness; now and then an orderly clerk
looked at me quietly though searchingly and then continued
his writing.</p>

<p>I wondered where the mistake had been, and where
I was really to go; but most of all I wondered at the
suspicious glances that were flashed at me by different
ones who came into the room. I waited for a long
time, almost two hours; once or twice I was questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
by the adjutant, and after each visit I wondered why
he was questioning me so. Then the colonel came in,
and he had not questioned me very long till I became
aware that I had been suspected as a spy. I was
asked to remain in the orderly room till more word
might be received.</p>

<p>I felt very much like laughing at my predicament,
for I knew that it would not be very long before headquarters
would learn my history.</p>

<p>In about an hour I was told that I might take the
battalion chaplain’s billet and that I was to stay with
the Seventy-fifth till orders would come. There had
been some misdirection of orders.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXXVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Held For Orders</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I remained a week with the Seventy-fifth before any
further orders came. The battalion was resting after
the terrible fighting at Paschendale. After dinner in
the evenings we would gather before the little open
coal fire in our mess: the second in command, who was
a lieutenant-colonel, the doctor, the quartermaster,
transport officer, and chat pleasantly. They were very
friendly, though at times experiences were related; I
think, for no other end than—in the language of the
army—to put my “wind up.” I tried not to let them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
see how well they were succeeding. I found the medical
officer, Dr. Hutchinson, to be the friendliest of the
officers. He was an American, a young man with grey
hair, whose home town was not very far from that
of Irvin Cobb. The way he came to talk of Cobb was
on account of one of his stories that he happened to
be reading. I learned through the papers later on,
that Dr. Hutchinson had won the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>There was another officer in the mess with which
I was quartered, who kept us all in a continual state
of anxiety. He was a light-hearted, merry, boyish
fellow and just a wee bit reckless. It was on account
of the cane he carried. Of course, all commissioned
officers in the British army are supposed to carry a
cane or a hunting crop, but not the kind of cane the
young officer in question carried. The cane was in
reality a miniature breech-loading shot-gun which took
a very small cartridge of very small shot. He had already
wounded one man slightly.</p>

<p>One day while taking a walk out through the country
from Calonne-Ricouart I saw for the first time the
transport section of a battalion of the French army.
It was drawn up on the roadside, all the wagons, limbers,
etc., were painted a grayish-blue color. The
horses were busy with their nose-bags, and the soldiers,
in blue uniform, were standing in little groups about
limbers taking their dinner, which consisted of cold
beef, white bread and red wine. They were all small
men, most of them with long black, silky beards. They
chatted among themselves, and all along the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
street French women and children looked out from
windows; I noticed tears in the eyes of some of the
women.</p>

<p>It was a scene that had been enacted many times
in the history of France. It was very interesting to
watch those blue-clad soldiers of the Old World standing
in small groups in the little lane. Perhaps, I
thought, in the many wars of France there have been
many such halts in this tiny village.</p>

<p>I was walking along musing so, when for one reason
or another I turned my eyes from the transport column
and looked down the road. Coming towards me on
horse-back was a trooper of the Canadian Light Horse.
He was a large, clean-shaven man under his wide-brimmed
hat. He sat with perfect ease in the saddle,
and looked quietly over the French transport section
as he went. There seemed to be some indefinable atmosphere
about the man that made one think of great,
illimitable spaces, of unrestricted freedom of movement.
A few seconds previous I had been thinking
of the romance of old France, but I had not been prepared
for this inset. A breath, strong and clear, of
my homeland came to me, and I felt proud of my
countryman.</p>

<p>I used to say Mass every morning in the little church
of the village, the pastor of which was a very delicate
looking young French curé. Two black-bearded
French soldier-priests said Mass before me. Then at
7:30, when the Masses were finished, the parish priest
taught catechism to the children of his parish. Later,
in many places where we came to rest, I saw early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the morning little children assembled in their parish
churches for catechism.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<small><span class="smcap">The Front at Last</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had been with the Seventy-fifth Battalion about
six days when one evening the adjutant gave me a
letter which contained orders to proceed the following
morning to Camblain L’Abbey. It was well on towards
evening when the large motor lorry, on the seat of
which I sat next the driver, pulled into the village of
Camblain L’Abbey. The old stone church stood on a
hill, looking down over the town, and at the base of
the hill in a long, level field stood row upon row of
one-story Nissen huts, in which were the headquarters
of different branches of service of the Canadian
Corps.</p>

<p>The lorry stopped at the end of a large plank walk,
down which I was directed to walk till I should come
to the headquarters of chaplain service. This did not
take very long, for presently I was standing before
one of the huts, on the door of which appeared the
letters C. A. C. S. (Canadian Army Chaplain Service).
I knocked on the door and stepped in.</p>

<p>Three military chaplains were sitting in the office;
one who bore the insignia of lieutenant-colonel, was
signing some papers for a young chaplain who was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
captain. The third chaplain, a major, sat in a far
corner eating nut-chocolate bars. I looked from one
to another. I did not know any of them. I had been
expecting to meet Father French, who was the senior
Catholic chaplain of the Canadians in France. I
made myself known, only to find that all the chaplains
were Anglicans, and that Father French was
absent on duty and would not be home for two or three
days.</p>

<p>That night I dined with many of the staff officers
of the Canadian Corps, and slept in the quaint little
presbytery of the French curé on the hill. The following
evening towards sundown, in company with
Lt. Colonel McGrear, chief chaplain for the Church of
England, I went to Carency, where I became attached
for quarters and rations to the Sixteenth Canadian
Scottish, which was one of the battalions of the Third
Canadian Infantry Brigade of which I was now R. C.
chaplain. My other battalions were the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth and Fifteenth. All, with the exception of
the Fourteenth, were kilted battalions, and each one
had its own band of bag-pipes.</p>

<p>I was somewhat disappointed to find myself attached
to the Sixteenth as the Catholic chaplain who had proceeded
me had been quartered with the Fourteenth in
which was an average of four hundred Catholics; in
the Sixteenth the average was about eighty. There
was some military reason for my appointment, so all
I could do was to obey orders.</p>

<p>We left Camblain L’Abbey and the motor went quickly
over the well-kept road. Soon the town, with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the houses still intact, was left far behind, and presently,
not far ahead, I saw a large sign-board attached
to two posts about fifteen feet high. At the top, in
large black block letters, were the words “Gas Alert,”
and beneath were words to the effect that from now
on all troops must wear their gas masks “at the alert.”
This meant that instead of carrying the mask at the
side, with the bag closed, it must be tied about the
chest, with the bag open, so that in a moment the
mask might be raised to the face.</p>

<p>A little nervousness came over me, for now on all
sides were signs of great devastation—broken and
torn buildings, crumbled walls, fields deeply marked
with shell-holes; and the road became rough, for it had
been mended in many places after being rent by shells.
Less traffic appeared along our way; everything seemed
quiet. On our right, in the distance, I noticed what
seemed to be a square forest of miniature trees, which,
as we drew nearer, became regular in shape and equidistant
from one another. As we came still nearer
I noticed low mounds, “row on row.” What had
seemed to be trees were crosses—a great forest of
little low crosses—and between the rows and rows of
crosses were the long lines of “the little green tents
where the soldiers sleep.” We passed two or three
other military cemeteries, then the ruins of a small
village or two, where many soldiers looked out from
cellar windows or low huts built of pieces of broken
stone and scraps of corrugated iron, with a piece of
burlap hanging and weighted at the end for a door.
Dugouts were built into the hill that sloped up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the roadside. The silence of the whole countryside
seemed uncanny. We came up a little hill where, on
our right a few hundred feet back from the road, were
perhaps a dozen corrugated iron stables, open at the
sides, but with a partition the whole length of the hut
running through the middle. In the foreground was
the basement of what had once been a long, narrow
dwelling-house. Here we stopped, for we had come to
headquarters of the Sixteenth Battalion, or, to give
them their full name, the Sixteenth Canadian Scottish.
They were a kilted battalion, hailing from British Columbia.</p>

<p>The colonel told me to remain in the motor till he
returned from the orderly room, which I did. In a
few minutes he came back with the adjutant and two
soldiers. The adjutant welcomed me kindly; the two
soldiers picked up my bed-roll and began to carry it
towards headquarters. I shook hands with the colonel
as he said good-bye. Then I accompanied the adjutant
to headquarters. I had arrived at the Western Front.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XXXIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Strafe and a Quartet</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>My room was a partitioned off portion at the end of
the cellar in which was headquarters: there was no
fire in it and the month was December. Through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
cracks in the portion of the building that was above
ground, blew the cold, wintry wind.</p>

<p>That night at dinner in “the mess,” which was in
the portion of the cellar adjoining my billet, I met a
number of the officers—though the majority were still
in the line—and they were among the finest men I
had ever met. The commanding officer, Colonel Peck,
one of the best-loved men on the Western Front, was
a huge man with a black drooping mustache which
gave him a rather fierce appearance, but there was a
look of real kindness in his eyes. He possessed the Distinguished
Service Order Medal, and later he won
the highest decoration of the British army, the Victoria
Cross. At that time, although we did not know
it till later, he had been elected a member of the Canadian
parliament.</p>

<p>When I returned to my billet I found a lighted candle
sticking to the bottom of an upturned condensed milk
tin; some one had been showing me an act of kindness.
I had no sooner entered than there was a knock on the
door. A young soldier opened it and came in. He
said he had come to open my bed-roll and prepare my
bed. I looked at the berth, which was a piece of scantling
about seven feet long running the width of the
room, to which was attached two thicknesses of burlap
about a yard wide that were fixed to the wall. I wondered
how I was going to sleep, for I was shivering
then. Suddenly the young soldier ceased tugging at
the straps, listened quietly for a second or two, then
not looking at me, but keeping his eye fixed on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
bed-roll, he said slowly and solemnly, as if addressing
some imaginary person in the bed-roll: “All is quiet
on the Western Front.”</p>

<p>He neither smiled nor looked at me, but continued
his work.</p>

<p>For months I had read those words in the daily
papers of England; but now there was something so
comical in the lad’s manner of saying them that I could
not help laughing as he went on with his unpacking.</p>

<p>But it was not for long that “all was quiet on the
Western Front.” Suddenly I heard a far-distant rumble
which had the rhythmic roll of snare-drums, yet the
sound was much stronger and it was increasing quickly
in intensity and volume. Soon it was a great thundering
roar with a minor rattle. The earth seemed to
be trembling.</p>

<p>I looked at the soldier. “A bombardment?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he said quietly, “that’s just a strafe over
on the LaBassée front. Those are our guns. Fritzy’ll
open up after they stop. You should go outside and
see it, sir.”</p>

<p>I stepped out, almost falling into a trench that was
just outside my door. Away to the northeast for about
a mile flitted short, sharp yellow flashes of light. Although
the rumbling of the guns was so loud, I judged
them to be five or six miles distant. Everything was
quiet about where I stood. It was a moonlight night
and along the white road, as far as I could see, was a
line of broken trees, with here and there the irregular
walls of a ruined village.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Presently there was a lull, then complete silence;
in the clear moonlight, the devastated countryside gave
one a weird impression. Then “old Fritzy opened
up,” and although the rumble of his guns was not
so distinct, I judged that he was giving us about as
much as we had given him. I wondered how much
harm would be done, and whether many of our lads
would be killed. Then slowly the firing ceased and
presently again “all was quiet on the Western Front.”</p>

<p>I was just about to reënter my quarters when I received
another surprise. From a hut just a few yards
away came sounds of singing. I listened: it was a low,
sweet song that I had never heard before—a quartet,
and the harmony seemed perfect. I had never before
heard such sweet singing. An officer came out of the
mess and stood near me, listening in silence. Then he
said: “That’s pretty good, Padre.” I agreed with
him, but I confessed I had never heard the song before.</p>

<p>“Why, Padre,” he said, “the name of that song is
‘Sweet Genevieve’. Strange you never heard it!
Wherever men are congregated one will hear that
song. It’s an old song, Padre. Strange you never
heard it!”</p>

<p>So I had heard two sounds that I had never before
heard: one was the sound of a “strafe” on the Western
Front; the other was the singing of “Sweet Genevieve.”</p>

<p>When I reëntered my hut I found that the young
soldier had opened my bed-roll and removed the few
little articles that were in it. The bed-roll was arranged
for the night on the burlap berth.</p>

<p>“You haven’t enough blankets, sir,” he said. Then
he was gone; but in about five minutes he was back
again with two thick brown army blankets. After I
had thanked him, he looked around to see if he could
improve anything before leaving for the night. Not
seeing anything, he was just about to open the door
when he turned and said: “If old Fritz comes over to
bomb us tonight, sir, the safest place for you will be
down in the trench. It’s a moonlight night and Fritzy
likes to be out in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>There was no bombing that night, but it was so extremely
cold that I could not sleep. I spent the night
changing from one position to another in the hope of
getting warm, but I remained awake till daylight.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock the following morning I heard
a fumbling at the latch of my door. I had just finished
my prayers. I waited, for I knew the door was
not locked; then as the latch was raised the door
opened, assisted by the foot of the one entering. First
there appeared a large granite iron plate of steaming
porridge and a smoky hand holding it, then a granite
iron mug of something steaming, and another smoky
hand holding it. Then appeared the kindly soldier of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the night before, his pleasant face a little begrimed,
but smiling, the arm of the hand which held the mug
hugging to his side a small earthen jar of sugar with
a spoon in it. I went to his assistance and soon we had
the things spread out on an upturned ration box which
had been the seat. Now it was the table, and the bed
was my seat.</p>

<p>“How did you sleep, sir?” asked the soldier. I told
him. Then he said he must try to find something to
make a stove. He went on to tell me that he and the
cook had built one, but that it was not working well.
He held up his hands as evidence, and I looked at his
face. “The cook is out there now,” he said, “trying
to cook the breakfast, and swearing, for there’s more
smoke coming out around the stove than there is going
up the chimney.”</p>

<p>I poured from the earthen mug a little of the hot
diluted condensed milk over the steaming porridge,
and the soldier told me to take all the sugar I wanted
as there was plenty. He stood beside me for a while
waiting to see if I would make any comment on the
porridge. I had never been in the habit of eating any
cereal at breakfast, but this morning I was very cold
and also very hungry. I tasted the porridge; it was
hot, piping hot. It tasted slightly of smoke, but that
didn’t matter. “It’s fine,” I said.</p>

<p>“Not smoky?” he asked.</p>

<p>I assured him that if it was a little bit smoky it made
no difference. He went out again; but I had not quite
finished the porridge before I heard another fumbling
at the latch, and in a moment he appeared again with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
another granite iron plate on which were two rashers
of bacon and a large slice of toast; in the other hand
was a large mug of hot tea.</p>

<p>“Is this dinner?” I asked.</p>

<p>The lad smilingly told me to eat all I could, that
when a man loses sleep the best way to make up for it
is by a good meal. He picked up the empty porridge
plate and the empty mug, leaving the sugar-bowl, and
went out again; but in about three minutes he was
back with a jar of compound jam, strawberry and
gooseberry.</p>

<p>“Has the cook stopped swearing yet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the lad, “I told him you said the
porridge was good. He knew it wasn’t, and when he
saw your empty plate he smiled. He’ll be all right
now for awhile.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of this place?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Carency,” he replied, “in the Souchez Valley. Just
across the road, on the other side of the valley, is
where the sixty thousand French soldiers and civilians
were gassed. Their own turpinide gas that they had
sent over against the Germans came back on them. The
wind had changed. There are some of the victims in
the wood that have never been buried. The valley is
called Valley of the Dead.”</p>

<p>He went on to tell me of the great battles that had
already been fought in the area where we now were.
I learned that we were almost at the base of Vimy
Ridge.</p>

<p>“What is the difference between a ‘strafe’ and a
‘bombardment?’” I asked him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Well,” he said, “a bombardment is usually all
thought out beforehand and a lot of preparations are
made for it and it usually lasts a long time. A ‘strafe’
is just a firing that might start up any time, and it
generally lasts only a few minutes. Sometimes a green
hand in the line brings off a ‘strafe’ that might last
half an hour with the loss of many lives and the cost
of thousands of dollars. The first night in the line
every minute or two some fellow thinks he sees some one
coming across ‘No Man’s Land’ and sometimes
he ‘gets the wind up’ pretty bad and fires. Then old
Fritz thinks some one is coming towards him and he
fires back; then two or three of our fellows answer,
and immediately old Fritz comes back stronger. Then
the whole line opens up and the machine-guns begin
to rat-tat-tat, and an S. O. S. flare goes up for the
artillery, and presently the earth is rocking under a
‘strafe’ and everybody except one wonders who started
it all.”</p>

<p>As the lad then began to gather up the empty dishes,
I made apologies for having eaten so much; always
my breakfast had been just a little bread and jam.
His only comment was, “Sorry, sir, I didn’t have a
couple of eggs for you.”</p>

<p>Long after he went out I kept thinking of the horrors
of war; what catastrophes might transpire through
the changing of the wind or through “getting the
wind up.”</p>

<p>After I had returned home from the war I was
giving a series of lectures in a little town. In one of
them I happened to mention the terrible tragedy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the turpinide gas. Many among my audience found
it hard to believe that there had been so many victims.
The following day the priest with whom I was
staying asked me many questions about the Valley of
the Dead. A day or two later, as we were sitting
in his office, one of his parishioners came in on some
business. I was about to leave the room when the
priest motioned me to stay.</p>

<p>When the man had finished his business, he looked
at me and said: “So you have been to the war,
Father?”</p>

<p>I said I had been there.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the man, who had come a long
distance, “I met a lad who was through it all, and he
told me he found the gas worse than anything. He
said he was in a place, one time, where thousands and
thousands had been froze stiff by a strange kind of gas.
He said that there was a church there, filled with
people sitting in the pews, and the windows were all
up, and this gas came right in through the windows
and froze all the people in the pews. They’re all there
yet, and if you pay a quarter you can see them.”</p>

<p>The man was most serious. I did not dare look at
the priest till he had gone. For a moment the priest
shook with laughter, then he said to me: “Father,
send for that returned man and make him your assistant.
He can tell the story much better than you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “considering that it was France, they
might have made the admission fee one franc instead
of a quarter.”</p>

<p>However, my story had not been exaggerated.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">New Friends</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the young soldier left there was another
knock on my door, and as I stood up to go to
open it I heard outside the voice of a man speaking
as if to a child. When I opened the door, there stood
a kilted officer over six feet in height, with the pleasant
face of a boy. He was accompanied by a billy-goat,
the mascot of the battalion. The officer greeted
me warmly and then looked at the goat, saying:
“Shake hands, Billy, shake hands with the new
Padre.” So Billy and I shook hands, or rather, I
shook Billy’s raised hoof.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I took a walk along the Valley of
the Dead. Away in the distance I noticed a large
balloon far up in the air and, seemingly, two men
standing in the large basket attached to it. It was
the first time I had ever seen a balloon and I was a
little surprised to find that it was not round, but
shaped like a sausage. It was a greyish-khaki color.</p>

<p>The sun was just setting far away behind the broken
trees when I walked back from Neuville St. Vaast; the
sky was pink with here and there a pencil of red clouds.
Along the skyline flew three homing airplanes. As I
turned to see if any more planes were coming, I noticed
the large balloon being hauled slowly down towards
the earth.</p>

<p>When I entered my little billet, I found the young
soldier at work putting up a stove that he had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and patched with a piece of tin. I asked him what the
great balloon was doing up in the air. He told me
that it was an observation balloon, and that the two
men in the aerial car were observing with field-glasses
what was going on behind Fritz’s line. The airplanes
that I had seen wending their way against the winter
skyline were scout planes that had been patrolling the
sky for hours. “Now,” he said, “they are going
home to roost.”</p>

<p>Before the stove was finished the Third Brigade interpreter—the
men always called the interpreter “the
interrupter”—came to visit me. He was the first
Catholic I had met since coming to the Sixteenth. He
seemed very friendly and kind. The badge of his
office was a sphinx. It was Napoleon who designed
this badge for interpreters—I suppose to remind them
that although they would learn much that was occurring,
it was part of their office not to divulge it. The
interpreter’s work was made very hard at times by the
good peasants of France. Sometimes, while marching
through a rich farmland, a soldier lad would “annex”
a hen, or a head of cabbage, or some grapes, or apples,
etc.; then the irate owner would seek the interpreter
and oblige him to conduct him or her before the proper
military authorities, where compensation would be
demanded from the government.</p>

<p>The cook also came in to see me; he, too, was a
Catholic and seemed to be a lad full of energy. I was
surprised to learn that in private life he was a tailor.
Before he left, he made arrangements for going to
confession. Then, by some strange association of ideas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
I asked him if his stove still smoked. It was going
much better now, he said.</p>

<p>That evening after dinner as I sat wiping my eyes
with my handkerchief, when it was not being applied
to my nose—for besides giving real warmth, the new
stove emitted a quantity of smoke—an officer knocked
and came in, followed by two soldiers carrying his
bed-roll. I had been expecting him, for in the mess
just before dinner I had heard the officers planning the
allotment of sleeping space for the night. A number
had been sleeping in their bed-rolls on the floor of the
mess; and now two or three other officers were coming
back from leave. I had heard an officer say: “We’ll
put ‘Wild Bill’ with the Padre.” The others had
agreed to this.</p>

<p>I had been wondering who “Wild Bill” was. I
did not think the officers were playing a practical joke
on me, for I had always found officers most respectful
to the priesthood. But now “Wild Bill” had entered,
and as I looked through the slight smoke-screen, my
eyes rested on one of the gentlest-mannered men I have
ever met. Without being in the least effeminate, he
came quietly over and shook hands. I understood
now why they called him “Wild Bill” for I recalled
that at college one of the slowest moving lads I had
ever met, had been rechristened “Lightning.” I felt
grateful to the other officers who had billeted “Wild
Bill” with me.</p>

<p>He slept in his bed-roll on the floor, after he had
spread a rubber ground sheet over it. Gradually the
room became sufficiently warm to sleep in. The soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
had found some coal. And as the smoke died away
I fell asleep and did not awake until morning.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Little Burlap Room</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following day was Saturday and I began to
think of my duties for the morrow. I had learned that
the Thirteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth battalions
would remain in the trenches till Monday. I called at
the orderly room of the Fourteenth only to learn that
they would be moving Sunday. When I returned to
my billet I found a letter from Father MacDonnell,
telling me to call to see him at the Transport Section
of the Seventy-second Battalion. I did, and found a
little man, dressed in Scotch military costume—tartan
riding breeches, round-cornered khaki tunic and
glengarry cap. The Seventy-second was a Scotch battalion
from Canada, but its chaplain was a Canadian
from Scotland. He had been a member of the Benedictine
Monastery, at Fort Augustus, Scotland. He
was then busy composing a little work on the Holy
Name, for he was anxious to establish the Holy Name
Society among not only the Catholic soldiers, but also
all other denominations. This was accomplished later
with the co-operation of the general commanding officer
of the Canadian Corps, Sir Arthur Currie. He
was not a young man: his hair was beginning to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
grey. I took him to be about fifty years old. He
wished me to work with him on Sunday. This I did,
saying Mass in a large Y. M. C. A. tent, while he said
Mass some distance farther down the valley. I did
not have many at Mass, but a good number came to
Communion. Most of the men were in the trenches.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, towards three o’clock, I heard the
inspiring strains of a military march coming up the
Valley of Death. I knew the march well. It was “The
Great Little Army,” one of the most popular marches
on the Western Front. I stepped outside and looked
down the valley. A battalion of infantry was marching
back from the line.</p>

<p>“It’s the Fourteenth,” said a young soldier standing
nearby.</p>

<p>I watched them carefully. The Fourteenth was one
of my battalions. I had heard of it before; it had been
the sacrificed battalion in one of the big battles. The
men had advanced without support in order to give
the enemy the impression that we were stronger than
we really were. They had suffered terrible casualties,
but their manoeuvre had met with great success. I
watched them till they disappeared round a turn in
the road—Hospital Corner, I think it was called—and
still I stood listening to the band. Very likely I
would meet these lads on Christmas Day—which
meant within the week.</p>

<p>I had no sooner returned to my “room” when the
young soldier who had been so thoughtful of my interests
came in. “Sir,” he said, “the colonel and all
the headquarters’ officers have gone to Chateau de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Haie; the battalion is going there tomorrow. I think
you should take the colonel’s room before any one else
gets it.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes all my belongings were in the room
just vacated by the colonel. It was a warm room completely
lined with burlap: ceiling, walls and floor were
covered with it. There was a small burlap-covered
table and a low bench, about three feet long, also with
a covering of burlap, but above all else, there was a
tiny stove with two doors that slid back so that one
could see the fire burning in it. Since then I have been
in very much worse quarters on the Western Front.</p>

<p>The following morning I said Mass on the little table,
and the cook, who had now only four officers to provide
for, came to Holy Communion. The next morning
the interpreter, with a young soldier who was being
called home to Halifax to care for his wife and child
who had just passed through the terrible disaster, knelt
reverently in the little burlap room to receive their
Lord.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XLIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Christmas at the Front</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We had planned to have midnight Mass in one of
the large moving-picture huts at Chateau de la Haie,
for here in reserve were four full battalions: one belonging
to Father MacDonnell, one to Father Murray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
a young chaplain whom I met just before Christmas,
and two, the Fourteenth and Sixteenth, belonging to
me. My other battalions were only about two miles
beyond these, the Thirteenth at Petit Servans and the
Fifteenth at Grand Servans. But First Divisional
Headquarters, which was then at Chateau de la Haie,
reconsidered the matter. They thought the Catholic
soldiers coming in at such an early hour might disturb
others who would wish to sleep; and, also, that there
might be too many lights used, so that some aerial
Santa Claus from across the line might wing his way
above the camp, dropping a few Christmas bombs in
passing. We then decided to have two Masses in the
large hut at Chateau de la Haie and one in the church
at Petit Servans. Fathers Murray and MacDonnell
were to say the Masses at Chateau de la Haie and I
was to go to Petit Servans.</p>

<p>I found that not only had I to notify the men of my
own battalions, but also all the units in my area. As
there were about ten other units—labor groups, engineers,
divisional trains, etc.—this took me quite a
while. In fact, it took all Monday afternoon. But the
following morning, which was Christmas, when I
turned around after the gospel to say a few words to
the lads, I felt more than repaid for any inconvenience,
including my four mile walk from Carency to Petit
Servans before Mass, for the church was filled. All
the seats were occupied and the large space in the
rear was packed with standing soldiers—kilted laddies
from the Thirteenth and Fifteenth, with their officers;
soldiers from the engineers; members of the labor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
groups; stretcher-bearers from the First Field Ambulance.
With a full heart I thanked the Christ Child
for bringing together all my Catholic men. It was the
first time in four months that I had been able to assemble
such a large number. At the hospital, naturally,
the groups were small. And as I looked at the sea
of faces, so reverently attentive, many bearing marks
of the terrible conflicts through which they had passed,
I felt a twitching at the throat, so that it was a few
seconds before I could begin to speak.</p>

<p>It was a long while that Christmas Day before I
finished giving Holy Communion, for nearly all the
men in the church came.</p>

<p>On my way home I learned from Father Murray that
the Fourteenth and Sixteenth had attended Mass in a
body in the moving-picture hut at Chateau de la Haie,
and that great numbers had gone to Holy Communion.</p>

<p>My Christmas dinner was a piece of dry roast beef,
almost burnt, some potatoes, bread and margarine, with
a little apricot jam and a cup of tea; that was all.
Yet I think it was the happiest Christmas I ever spent,
for, as I thought of that first wonderful meeting with
those Canadian Catholic soldiers on the Western Front,
I felt that in their midst those words, written so long
ago, “There was no room in the inn,” could not be
said that Christmas Day.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XLIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Back to Rest</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Every morning for a week or two I was in the little
church where I had said Mass on Christmas Day, and
every evening while I was there men came to confession.
Then one morning the young soldier who had
been so attentive to my wants, and whose name I had
learned was George, came into the burlap room in a
state of evident excitement and said: “We’re going
back to rest, sir.”</p>

<p>I did not know exactly what “back to rest” really
meant, but I judged from George’s sparkling eyes
that it was something very good. “That’s good news,”
I said. But one had to be a soldier of the line to realize
what good news it really was. One must be actually
in the trenches when the word comes to comprehend
fully what those words “back to rest” mean.</p>

<p>“We’re going back to rest, chummy,” somebody
says, and the word is relayed quickly down the front
line trench. And tired-faced lads, many of them with
faint, dark rings around their eyes, smile broadly as
they stand half-crouching in the muddy trench. Onward
the glad tidings go, whispered or uttered in low
voices: “Out to rest, Bo; the relief’s coming in tonight
at half-past ten. Hooray!” But the “hooray”
does not express adequately the feelings of the speaker.
It must do, however, as a loud cheer is not permitted
in the front line trench.</p>

<p>When it is dark, the relief comes in very quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and takes over the different posts; then, as quietly, the
lads go down the support trenches till they slope up to
the great wide road that seems so spacious and airy
after the deep, narrow trench they have been standing
in for days. On they go, past long rows of broken trees
that once were majestic, full-leafed elms, then through
masses of ruined buildings and broken stone walls,
with here and there a small corrugated iron hut or
shack, built just lately. At times, not very far away,
a long yellow flash, followed by a thundering report,
tells them that our heavies are at work.</p>

<p>Somebody begins to whistle, “There’s a long, long
trail a-winding,” or “Over There,” then others catch
the lilt, and in a few seconds hundreds are whistling
to the swinging, sweeping thud of marching feet. When
they get a little farther on their way, the whistling
ceases and a song is struck up, though not too loudly.
Above them are the silent stars peacefully shining.
Away behind them shrapnel bursts savagely and
sprinkles its death-bearing message. But that is far
behind, and now they are going out—out to rest!</p>

<p>Perhaps they march all through the night, carrying
their equipment and their heavy packs on their backs,
and as the dawn comes, they notice at every cross-road
a great cross, and nailed to the cross the figure of the
Crucified—white, blood-streaked, the thorn-crowned
head bent in the agony of suffering, the face livid with
pain and misery. And many a lad under his weight
looks up. He understands it all much better now than
when he first came to the front. Some breathe a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
prayer. They are going out to rest—but they will be
coming back again!</p>

<p>They continue their march till the morning sunlight
begins to brighten all the land and the roar of the guns
has become but a faint distant rumble, then, perhaps,
they sit on the roadside, or along the edge of a field,
the grass of which looks so fresh and green after the
rolling, shell-torn No Man’s Land they have been looking
over for days, where never a blade of grass could
be seen; only the grey shell-pitted earth, with here and
there a line of white chalk which made one think of a
white-capped, angry sea. Birds begin to sing in field
and green wood, and from many field kitchens and little
red fires built on the roadside comes the odor of frying
bacon.</p>

<p>Some of the lads take off their packs and go to sleep
on the roadside, their faces grey with the dust from
marching feet. Much traffic goes by—khaki motor
lorries, general service wagons, dispatch riders on
motorcycles. Then from the distance come the strains
of a military march played by a brass band that is approaching;
it may be “Colonel Bogey” that they play,
or “Sons of the Brave,” etc. It is the band of the battalion
coming to meet the lads and play them back to
rest.</p>

<p>When every one has eaten his bread and bacon and
has finished his pint of hot tea, they fall in, feeling
much refreshed. Then there is a rumble from the big
drum and a rattle from the smaller ones and the inspiring
music of a military march breaks on the air.
The lads straighten momentarily under their packs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and there is a new swing to their tired feet. Perhaps
they pass through many fields lined with tall elms.
Perhaps they pass many French peasants, old and
young, going to work in the fields, who smile pleasantly.
They may go through a quiet little village or two
till they come to a more flourishing one in which is a
large chateau. Then the band, which for the last
fifteen minutes has given place to a few buglers and
drums, strikes up the battalion’s own march and the
order comes ringing down the line, “March to attention.”
Then the tired lads know that they are coming
into rest billets.</p>

<p>The organization in “rest” is done very quickly.
One battalion takes over from another, and in a very
short time enamel signs are hung out of billets which
tell where are the different officers and orderly rooms.
If there is a curé in the village, and if it so happens
that the Catholic chaplain of the brigade is quartered
with the battalion that has come to rest here, a little
sign hangs from the curé’s gate, bearing the words
“R. C. Chaplain,” for the soldiers’ priest is nearly
always billeted with the parish priest of the village;
and on the church door a paper is tacked giving the
hours of Mass, confession, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no curé in the village; perhaps
he has been called to join the soldiers of France; perhaps
at one time the village has been heavily shelled
and he has followed his people. In this case, often it
is necessary to renovate the little shell-torn church,
but this is quickly done. And in the morning, after
Mass has been said, a tiny lamp burns in the church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
which tells the soldiers that the Master has come and
is calling them.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock the soldiers’ work for the day,
when they are out in rest, usually finishes, and they
receive any papers and magazines that may have come
to them from friends across the sea. These are very
welcome arrivals, and so are the boxes of good things
that sometimes come from home. Then, as the lads
sit under trees, or in front of tents, or in low hay lofts
to eat their dinner, papers are opened and those who
have received boxes or parcels from home pass around
candies, cake, etc., to those who have not, and so a
very pleasant hour passes.</p>

<p>The afternoon is usually given over to games and
athletic sports. If different troops happen to be quartered
together in the same village the competition between
the two becomes very interesting. Perhaps a
baseball game is arranged between American and
Canadian lads, while English lads look on, it must be
admitted, with irritation. They cannot understand
why one side should shout such things at the other;
why they should try to rattle the pitcher. To them it
seems quite abusive, and judging from their talk, they
are disgusted. “Call that a gaime,” one will say,
“when one side keeps on ’ollerin’ at the blighter bowlin’
that ball, so’s ’e caunt throw well?” “Call that
sport?” “Call that fair ply?” “I carn’t see where
the fair ply comes hin when they tike such bloomin’
hunderanded wys o’ tryin’ to win.” His mate agrees
with him, and presently they move off to some other
scene of amusement. Meanwhile, little French boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
who have come to watch the baseball game go racing
about the field, imitating some of the plays in the game
which is so strange to them, and as they go sliding to
some imaginary home-plate, one can hear such expressions
as “Safe!” and “Hat a-boy.”</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when we left Chateau
de la Haie, for we were not under observation and it
was not necessary to move by night. We assembled
on one of the squares near a long, tree-fringed avenue
which was one of the approaches to the chateau. For
some time before we fell in I heard from all quarters
strange, unearthly noises, and in every direction I
turned I saw, at quite a distance from each other, kilted
figures walking up and down bearing their wide-branched
bag-pipes, each one emitting the weirdest
wails imaginable; they were the pipers of the Sixteenth
pipe band tuning up. However, when we started off
the sound was quite different, for the pipes and kettle-drums
make merry marching music. I know of no
other music that can make tired men march so briskly
and with such a swing as that of the pipes. I had
never before marched with any unit which seemed to
draw such universal attention as did the Sixteenth
Canadian Scottish Battalion, and I think it was owing
chiefly to the strange music of the pipes and the uncommon
uniform of the kilted laddies. For as we entered
village after village, doors and windows began to
open, and old and young and middle-aged French peasants
quickly filled them, smiling their admiration as
the pipers played and the soldiers marched. Little
“gamins,” not content with regarding us, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
along at a trot, singing and cheering; the more enterprising
among them, picking up a block of wood and
an old ration sack and, tucking them under their left
arm while they spread out three or four pieces of sapling
or old laths, gave an imitation of our brave pipers
who played so valiantly. I began to think, after all,
there might be some truth in the story of the Pied
Piper of Hamlin.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Bruay</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Our destination was Bruay, a mining town of about
twelve thousand souls in the department of Calais,
or, as the French write it, “Pas de Calais.” We
marched into the town at about two o’clock and fell
out at the square.</p>

<p>My billet was in a miner’s house. It was a very
nice room with a stove in it, and as there was a coal
mine just across the road, I did not want for fuel.
The transport mess, which was composed of the transport
officer, quartermaster, paymaster and chaplain,
was billeted in a large house not very far away. We
had a dining-room all to ourselves, but our cook operated
on the same stove as did old Madame, who was
the head of the house.</p>

<p>We were obliged to pass through the kitchen on our
way to the dining-room, and I found it a very pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
passageway, especially in the evening, for then it was
crowded with happy faces. Old Madame and our cook
both moved about the glowing stove where numerous
pots and saucepans, boilers and frying pans, hissed and
bubbled and sizzled, chatting away as they worked;
for our cook was a French Canadian. Four or five
soldiers sat about in the dim lamplight and numerous
children played up and down. Two young French
boys, one about sixteen, the other fourteen, snow-white
from head to foot, were often there; for old Madame
had quite a large bakery on the premises, and these
two lads, together with an old man whom we seldom
saw, did the baking. Now and again we saw two
women, the mothers of the children, who attended the
bake-shop, which was in the front of the house.</p>

<p>I asked George one day how the cook liked his stove.
I learned that he liked it very much, but that he had
his own little troubles, sometimes. When he would
have some deep red coals just ready for making toast,
old Madame would inadvertently throw a shovelful of
fuel on the fire; or, sometimes, when the water in the
kettle had just come to the boiling point and the cook
was just about to make some tea, Madame would judge
that the kettle needed replenishing and would immediately
pour in about a pint of cold water; or, sometimes,
a saucepan or some dish that needed quick
cooking was moved by Madame from the front to the
rear of the stove. “He finds it a little exasperating
at times,” said George, “but he’s delighted with the
billet.”</p>

<p>We passed a very pleasant time in rest billets. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
morning we were awakened by the pipe band playing
up and down the streets of Bruay. The tune they
played was that of an old Scotch song, “Hi Jonny
Coup are ye sleepin’ yet.” I said Mass in the ancient
church of the town, and while I did so the old curé
taught catechism to a large number of children. While
I made my thanksgiving a soldier-priest from one of
the ambulances said his Mass. He wore a mustache,
but no beard, as did many of the French soldier-priests.
It seemed strange to see a priest, robed in the vestments
of Mass, wearing a black mustache.</p>

<p>There was an Irish chaplain at No. 22 hospital, and
I arranged with him to say Mass for the Thirteenth
and Sixteenth at Bruay the following Sunday, while
I went to Houdain to say Mass for the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth and some details which were quartered there.
The church at Houdain was a beautiful old stone structure
built on the crest of a very high hill that overlooked
the town. A long road zigzagged up the hill,
breaking the steep ascent. The first time I went to
the church the old curé, a large red-cheeked man,
pointed out the different villages far over the countryside.
In one, the village of Arnette, he told me St.
Benedict Joseph Labre had been born, and in another—I
think it was Cauchy—General Petain, of the
French army. I was interested to learn that I was so
near the birthplace of St. Benedict Joseph Labre, since
my parents had given to me the same names, Benedict
Joseph.</p>

<p>I had a large crowd at Mass, and for the first time
I had the pleasure of seeing the Fourteenth Battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
on church parade. They were a fine crowd of lads;
many came to confession that day. Every evening
from five till six I was on duty either at Bruay or
Houdain, so that any one who wished to come to confession
might have the opportunity.</p>

<p>I remember one evening at Bruay, while awaiting
the arrival of a soldier whom I was going to baptize
and make a child of God, seeing a little girl with a
shawl thrown over her head praying before a statue;
near her, on the floor, was a bag made of some netted
material with quite a large mesh. In the bag were
two large rolls of French bread, and of course through
the mesh the bread touched the floor; but the child
paid no attention to this. She was rapt in prayer. I
could not help looking at her from time to time, she
reminded me so much of the pictures of little Bernadette
that were so common in France—except for
the two rolls of bread lying nearby in the dust. The
little one prayed for nearly an hour, and I don’t think
she turned her head once—not even to look at the
bread!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Fosse-Dix</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We were in rest nearly two weeks when orders came
to go back again to the line. We left one morning
immediately after breakfast and were reviewed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the march by General Sir Arthur Currie, commander
of the Canadians. Along the way we were greeted by
the same outspoken admiration as on our passing out.
On a veranda in front of a little estaminet an old
Frenchman, wearing the glazed, peaked yachting cap
which was the most common head-gear among men
in this part of France, tried to dance the “Highland
Fling,” to the great amusement of half the people in
the little street and the voiced encouragement of the
passing soldiers.</p>

<p>Fosse-dix was a very small village; it cannot be
found on the map, but Sains-en-Gohelle can be seen,
of which Fosse-dix was a suburb. We were to wait
here a few days in reserve before going into the trenches;
the Fifteenth and Sixteenth were here and the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth at Bully-Grenay. I was
billeted with the curé at Fosse-dix and I found him
a very pleasant little man and one of the most zealous
priests I have ever met. From three neighboring
parishes the pastors had been called to the colors; so
this little priest, who was none too robust—otherwise,
he, too, would have been called—tried to attend
the shepherdless flocks, and succeeded remarkably
well.</p>

<p>It was a mining district we were in: all over the
countryside could be seen the high smoke-stacks of
the blast furnaces. This was the part of France said
to contain the most natural wealth, and the Canadians
were proud that they had been chosen to defend it.</p>

<p>On Sunday I was to say two Masses: one at Fosse-dix
at nine o’clock, the other at Bully-Grenay at ten-thirty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
So on Saturday I went around to arrange for
these, taking nearly the whole day to visit the different
units in the area. Bully-Grenay, unlike Fosse-dix, had
been almost totally demolished by shell-fire. The
church had been damaged in places, though not too
seriously; but when I came in sight of the curé’s house
my heart turned sick. Nearly the whole of the second
story had been blown off, but the brave old priest
still lived in the lower story. I picked my way through
little piles of broken stone and plaster, with a few
pieces of splintered wood amongst the debris. I
knocked at the door and the old pastor himself opened
it. He was a stout, white-haired, kind-faced man who
smiled brightly as he shook my hand. “Ah,” he said,
“I have not seen you before! You are a new arrival.
Is it not so?”</p>

<p>I assured him that I had just lately come to the
Third Brigade, but that I had been on active service
in France since early in the past summer. “Ah,” he
said again, and he stood back and looked me over from
head to muddy boots. Then he called his old housekeeper,
and when she had come he said: “He has but
just lately come,” and the old housekeeper looked at
me quietly and smiled in a motherly way, then she
went to prepare a bowl of hot coffee for the “newly
arrived.”</p>

<p>As the old curé and I sipped the black coffee, I
asked him about his life; why he stayed there, etc.
He told me that many times the little village had been
shelled, and often the Germans had drawn very near
its outskirts, but always he had stayed. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
struck his house on different occasions. Many of his
people had gone, but there still remained about eighty,
all told; those, with their families, who were in different
ways connected with operations of the mine. Some
of his flock were obliged to stay here, and—well, he
must not leave them shepherdless. So the old pastor
remained.</p>

<p>When we had finished our coffee, he rose to his feet.
“Come,” he said, and I followed him through a tiny
passageway into a darkened room, for all the panes of
glass had been shattered in the window-frame and the
opening had been boarded across, save a small opening
where a piece of translucent paper had been
pasted. It was a few seconds before my eyes became
accustomed to the semi-darkness, but when they did
I was scarcely prepared for what they viewed. In
the middle of the room, reaching almost to the ceiling,
rose a great pyramid of bags of sand; in one side was
an opening, and in this, on the floor, was spread a
mattress and some bedding; this was where the old man
slept.</p>

<p>As I walked up the sunlit street after I had said
“au revoir” to the priest and his kind housekeeper, I
was filled with profound admiration for the old pastor.
I think it was the greatest admiration I have ever felt
for any man, and I quoted to myself: “The good
Shepherd loveth his flock.”</p>

<p>The following morning, as I stood in the shell-torn
church of Bully-Grenay after I had officiated for the
lads of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth at Fosse-dix, I
found the church packed with the lads of the Thirteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and Fourteenth. There was scarcely room in
the church for them all. I said a word about the old
pastor and—well, I don’t think it was often that the
collection plate was so well filled at Bully-Grenay as
it was that morning.</p>

<p>I returned to the church in the afternoon to hear
confessions and give Holy Communion, accompanied
by Father MacPherson of the Fifth Divisional Artillery.
We found the old pastor in the church teaching
catechism to the few little ones of his flock. They sat
on the high-backed chairs which are also used as
kneeling-benches by the people of France. And whenever
one or the other of us would come to the altar-rail
bearing the Bread of Life to a group of soldiers,
the old white-haired Shepherd, with his little flock,
would kneel, while through the roof, which had been
pierced in many places by shells, trickled the rain to
drop on the floor beneath, carrying with it powdered
plaster and flakes of calcimine.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XLVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Little Curé of Fosse-Dix</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Every evening at 4:30 the curé of Fosse-dix gave
Benediction in his little church for the school children
and any of the village people who could attend. After
Benediction he usually said the beads, the Litany and
a few other prayers, and before he finished my boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
used to arrive for confession. As the confessional was
in the rear of the church, facing the altar, I often
saw the children coming down the aisle. First, an old
Sister of Charity, her wide white coronet flapping on
either side like two white wings, backed slowly down
the aisle, the children coming two by two, facing her.
Generally as they came they sang a beautiful hymn to
the Sacred Heart, but I can only recall the last two
lines, which they always repeated. Translated, they
would read: “Heart of Jesus, heart of clemency, save,
save France in the name of the Sacred Heart!” The
children would walk in perfect order till they reached
the door where the old fat Sister stood watching them.
Although I could not see them then, I always knew
when each couple had passed the good Sister; a scampering
of feet and sometimes a little shouting were
the signals.</p>

<p>One evening while the children were going out in
the customary way, singing their beautiful hymn, I
noticed five or six soldiers in the French uniform of
grey-blue. They remained quiet while the children
were singing the first stanza, but when they came to
the lines I have quoted above, a great chorus sounded
as soldiers joined with the children in imploring the
Sacred Heart to save France.</p>

<p>Every evening, after coming from our mess, I stepped
into the curé’s room to have a chat with him.
Sometimes I had a box of good things that had come
from relatives back in Canada, for our Christmas
boxes were only now beginning to arrive. I remember
one evening opening a parcel while the little priest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
voiced his simple wonder at the strange things from
across the seas. He had never seen chewing gum before,
so I gave him a few sticks of Spearmint. In a
little while I looked at him, but his jaws were motionless
and the gum was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Where is your gum, Father?” I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me keenly, not understanding my question,
so I repeated it. Again he looked at me, but this
time he answered me.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “I swallowed it!”</p>

<p>Then, because I laughed heartily, I had to explain
to him how the people of the New World use gum.</p>

<p>One day while I was absent, working among the
soldiers, a shell came whistling over the village, bursting
in the road near his garden tearing several holes
in the brick wall of his house. When I returned he
took me out to see the havoc that had been wrought,
pointing out with minute care every place where a
splinter of shell had struck. He seemed to be taking
the whole thing so solemnly that I could not but become
solemn, too; so I said to him, as I pointed to
quite a large hole that had been torn through the
frame of a ladder resting against the house, supposing
he had been walking there, and that the shell had
burst in the road about that time, and his head had
been bent a little as the piece of shell went through the
ladder—I looked at him, shaking my head ominously
at the thought of what might have happened.</p>

<p>He looked at me quickly. “Oh, if!—if!—if!” he
said. “One could take Paris and put it in a bottle—if—it
would go in!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He had a pass from a British general which permitted
him to stop any military lorry going in his direction
and take passage on it. It was always a mystery
to the military chaplains how he had obtained it.
During the day he was off searching for chaplains
whose men were in the line and who could attend one
or more of his shepherdless flocks the following Sunday.
At different times throughout the early spring
campaign I was able to help him with his work, and
I always felt glad of the opportunity; for he was truly
a man of God.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XLVIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Into the Line</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following Sunday at Fosse-dix I gave the men
a general absolution and then Holy Communion, for
they were going in the line immediately; after the
service was over I asked them to leave me the addresses
of their next of kin. Both Sundays, while at Fosse-dix,
a young lieutenant served my Mass. The address that
he gave me was that of a Mrs. Maxwell-Scott, London,
England. I asked him if this was his mother’s address
and he said it was. Then I said, by way of a passing
remark, “I suppose you are a relative of Sir Walter
Scott.” To my surprise, he said he was. In the course
of the week some little pamphlets arrived for the
soldiers, and as I was examining them I noticed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the name of the author of several was Mrs. Maxwell-Scott.
The next time I met the young officer I asked
if the author of the Catholic pamphlets was a relation
of his. He smiled. “My mother,” he said.</p>

<p>As not half my soldiers were in the trenches the
first week, I did not spend all my time in the line.
There were confessions, and Masses to say for those
who were out. But I recall quite vividly the morning
before I went in the line for the first time. I felt a
great uneasiness, so that I could not stay very long
in the same place. I remember particularly the last
hour before the time to go arrived. I took a clean
sheet of paper, sat down at a table and made my last
will and testament. This I folded and placed in my
pocket Bible. Then I sat quietly for a while in the
little room till George came to tell me that a groom
was at the door with my horse, and that I was to
meet the officer with whom I was to go at the mess.</p>

<p>We rode over through Bully-Grenay, then up through
Grenay, where we left our horses with the groom;
from there on we walked through ruined buildings
till we came to a great open waste, zigzagged with
long white trenches. I had always expected to find the
trenches brown, but here they were chalk-white. We
passed Crucifix Corner, then left the road and walked
through a field or two above the trenches. I was
wondering when my companion would go down into
them, for we could now see Fritz’s line. We passed
Loos, on our right, which was nothing but a few shattered
walls standing, and the slag heap of a ruined
mine; then on our left, a place called Hulluch. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
was rather anxious to be down in the communication
trenches; the countryside appeared very level and always
we were drawing nearer the German front line.
My companion, a veteran of the Boer War, did not
seem to feel the slightest timidity. He had not spoken
now for a few minutes and the silence was oppressive.
As far as I could see, the whole countryside was criss-crossed
with trenches; hardly a living person could be
seen, yet in the twinkling of an eye the great gridiron
before me could be alive with thousands of men now
burrowing in the earth like foxes. I began to wish
that I, too, were between two walls of friendly earth.
Then the captain spoke:</p>

<p>“We’re under observation now, Padre. Fritz can see
us walking along.”</p>

<p>“Then, why doesn’t he fire at us?” I asked, but what
I really wished to say was: “Well, why don’t we jump
down into the trench and walk along it?” but I did
not say it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “we’re a little too far for good
rifle shooting, and shells cost too much to be wasted
on just two men.”</p>

<p>I drew a long breath, and felt grateful for the high
cost of shells! Then I heard words that were like
music to my ears: “Suppose we step down into the
trench, Padre.”</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Called Up</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Battalions
were in the line, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth were
still in reserve and support, and every evening I was
on duty at Bully-Grenay or Bracquemont to hear the
confessions of these troops.</p>

<p>I remember one evening while on my way from
Fosse-dix to Bracquemont, where the Thirteenth was
now quartered, hearing the strains of an accordion,
and a number of male voices singing some French
song. I stopped and looked back. Down the little
street came a strange procession. First, a young man,
badly crippled from some hip trouble, limped rather
quickly for one so stricken. High above him, from a
pole that he carried, waved a large tricolor of France.
Immediately behind him, still wearing his soldier’s
uniform, came a French soldier who had been wounded.
It was he who played the accordion. Then behind
him, and spread out the whole width of the
street, was a column of young men of about seventeen
or eighteen years of age. All were bedecked in gay
colors—sashes of crimson or yellow or green, etc.,
around the waist and over the shoulders; streamers of
different colored ribbons waving from their hats or
caps. As they advanced, they danced some strange
continental dance which now and again called for the
crossing of feet, and sometimes the resting of the
hand on the shoulder of a neighbor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>When they drew opposite me the singing and dancing
stopped, and they fell into a regular marching
step, while the wounded soldier played “Father of
Victory” march on his accordion. They passed me,
marching briskly and cheering irregularly. Doors
flew open in the little village of Bracquemont as they
entered, and mothers and sisters ran to them to see
the young lads as they passed.</p>

<p>When I came out from the church that evening the
lads were just coming back from the next town. Again
they were singing their song and dancing their fantastic
dance. Just as they neared the church, the Thirteenth
pipe band came behind them playing merrily.
Hearing it, the lads quickened their step till it was almost
in time with the Scotch music. On they went,
keeping ahead of the band, which was obliged to
slacken its pace a little, but it did so accommodatingly.</p>

<p>I stood near an old man watching the procession.
Alongside us were three middle-aged women who
smiled as it passed; but I saw tears on the cheeks of
one woman while she smiled.</p>

<p>The old man told me that this was the procession of
the young men who had just received their call to the
colors. Tomorrow they would leave. On my way back
to Fosse-dix I was wondering why it was that a lame
man carried the flag; then suddenly it came to me that
on account of his lameness he could not go to the war,
and that very likely for this reason each class, when
called, showed him the courtesy of appointing him to
lead the procession.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Bully Les Mines</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following week the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
moved up to the front line from reserve and we went
to Mazingarbe, only about four miles distant from
Fosse-dix. Here, again, I was billeted with a curé; a
comparatively young man, who was very distant in
manner, though most kind in helping me with my
work and seeing that I had everything I needed. His
church had been hit several times and part of the
sacristy had been blown off; the parish was being
shelled periodically. Mazingarbe was the name of the
town, but as there were two churches in it, within a
mile of each other, the parish in which I was billeted
was namely Bully-les-Mines.</p>

<p>Here I met for the first time, Father Madden, O. M.
I.; chaplain to the Second Brigade, and Father Lockary,
chaplain to the First Brigade. They gave me
very good advice concerning the performance of my
duties, for both had been at the front for many
months. Father Madden had been there longer than
Father Lockary, and he wore the little purple and
white ribbon of the Military Cross. I found my work
very easy the following Sunday.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, fully equipped with “steel
lid,” trench boots, pack on my back, I started for the
trenches, where I remained till the end of the week.
We had a little trouble getting up to headquarters,
for Fritz was shelling them when we arrived; but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
managed to make it between shells. Headquarters
was in the basement of what was once a hospital at
St. Pierre.</p>

<p>The first night in the line I slept in a cellar which
had been roofed over. On going from headquarters
to this cellar I was accompanied by an orderly; suddenly
I heard a report like a pistol-shot, and then a
hissing, as of an extra large sky-rocket tearing its way
up through the air. My companion caught me by the
arm and told me not to move. Then the hissing object
turned, burst into a brilliant light and began to descend
very slowly, lighting up the battle front for almost
a mile. Then the light went out and we went
onward. “A Verey light,” said the Corporal. “‘Old
Fritz’ must be getting ‘windy’. He’s been shooting
off a lot of Verey lights on this front. Always stand
perfectly still, Padre, when you see or hear a Verey
light.”</p>

<p>I had a companion in the cellar, the medical officer
of the Thirteenth, Captain Cochrane, who was a Catholic
and an American. All the wounded from the line
were to pass through his hands. We did not have
very many wounded.</p>

<p>My first visit to the Front Line trench was made
the second day of my visit. I went with the orderly
officer for the day, Lieutenant J. McIvor, M. C., who
was the only Catholic officer in the Sixteenth. The
chalk trenches were so similar, and so high, that I
could not tell when I was in the Front Line. Mr.
McIvor had been looking at me for awhile, then he
whispered: “We’re in the Front Line now, Father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Old Fritz is just across the way.” It seemed strange:
above us shells, going and coming, passed, making
sometimes a soft, sweeping sound: at others, a shrill,
whining noise. Everything was intensely quiet in the
trenches. We were so near the German line that the
occupants could be heard coughing, although I did
not have the unique experience of hearing them cough.</p>

<p>I stood up on the fire-step and peeped out over No
Man’s Land. Not a blade of grass could be seen,
nothing but the grey earth, that had been churned
and riddled and tossed about by every missile of war.
A little to my left a long green spar like a flag-staff
stood up in “No Man’s Land;” a little beyond this,
and behind Fritz’s line, was a partly demolished town.</p>

<p>I saw all this in a second or two, then I felt a hand
on my shoulder and a whisper came to my ear: “Not
too long, Father.”</p>

<p>I stepped down from the fire-step.</p>

<p>As we went back towards battalion headquarters, I
asked the officer the name of the town I had seen.</p>

<p>“Lens,” he said.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The One That Was Lost</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The winter passed quietly, each battalion of my
brigade moving from reserve to support, from support
into the line, then back to reserve again. And always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
in those little churches up near the line, whenever
there was a chaplain, confessions were heard from five
o’clock every evening. Here the work was most consoling,
for my soldiers, moving about the village in
the evening time, used to find their way to the church
and there make a little visit or go to confession and
Holy Communion. Often some would stay a long time
praying. They had left mothers and fathers, wives
and children, but the sanctuary lamp, burning softly,
sent to them the silent signal, as it did at home, that
“the Lord was in His holy temple.”</p>

<p>Often as I sat in the confessional in those little
churches of France I thought of God’s wonderful
ways; of the ineffable graces that flowed so continuously
to the souls of those lads. And many times, when
the evening’s work was done and the last soul shriven,
I have left my confessional and walked up the aisle
to the altar-steps, and, kneeling down, have thanked
God with a full heart for having made me a priest.</p>

<p>On one of those evenings, after I had finished hearing
confessions in the church at Bully-les-Mines, I
noticed an old soldier sitting in one of the middle pews.
He must have been nearly seventy; his hair was quite
gray. I waited in my confessional for a short time,
thinking perhaps he might wish to come, but as he
did not, I stepped out from the box and began to
walk up and down the aisle; and the old soldier stayed
on. At last I stopped at his pew and asked him if he
wished to go to confession.</p>

<p>He said “No,” and then went on to tell me that
he had been to prayers the night before, and that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
had come back again thinking there would be more
prayers. But he repeated that he did not wish to
go to confession.</p>

<p>I told him there would be the Way of the Cross
the following evening, which was Friday. The curé
was having Lenten devotions twice a week. I was
just about to leave the church then, as there was no
one else to go to confession, when the old soldier spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “would you like to talk to me?”
It seemed rather an unusual way to ask the question.
Usually men said: “Father, I’d like to speak to you
a minute.” However, if this man had anything he
wished to say to me, I was there to hear it and also
to help him by any advice I could. So I said that I
would like to talk to him, if he wished.</p>

<p>I then sat down beside the old man and slowly he
began to speak. “Father,” he said, “I don’t want
to go to confession—I haven’t been to confession for
forty years. I’ve led an awful life, Father. All that
time I have been trying to do without God. Lately,
though, Father, I have begun to think that I can’t
do it. Since I’ve come to France I’ve seen a lot, and
I’ve been thinking a lot. I’ve come to the conclusion
that there is some power directing all things. For
even to run a peanut stand there must be some one
behind it to direct things. I believe in God, Father—but
I don’t want to go to confession.”</p>

<p>He stopped speaking for a second or two, and we
sat in silence. Up before the tabernacle the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
flame in the sanctuary lamp leaped a few times. Then
he spoke again:</p>

<p>“But, Father, I have led an awful life!” He began
then and there to tell me the history of his life. I
listened quietly, and as he continued telling me of
forty years’ estrangement from God, I prayed with
all my strength to the Sacred Heart of Jesus for grace
to bring this poor lost sheep back into the fold. Surely
the Sacred Heart would hear my prayer. “I will
give to priests,” He had said, “the power to touch the
most hardened heart.”</p>

<p>For a long time I sat there and the old man continued
to talk. Now and again I would ask a question
by way of encouraging him in his recital.</p>

<p>At last he finished, and his head moved a little from
side to side, very slowly, as he said: “Father, I’ve
led an awful life!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “and now if you will come with me
into the confessional and ask God’s pardon from the
bottom of your heart for all those sins, I will give
you holy absolution.”</p>

<p>It was late that evening when the old man stepped
out from the confessional, but before he did he said
to me: “Father, if ever you wish to make known all
that has gone on this night, either by writing or word,
you have my permission to do so, for it might help
some other poor soul.”</p>

<p>All through his confession I had been praying for
grace to know what to do next. I wished to give him
holy communion, for one never knew when a missile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
of death might drop—just about that time a giant
enemy shell had crashed into the village so unexpectedly
that I saw a red-faced officer of the line turn a
sickly white. And yet the old soldier had been such
a long time away from the sacraments. But before
he left the confessional I had decided what to do.
“Now,” I said, “you will just go up to the sanctuary
rail and pray a little and then I will give you Holy
Communion.”</p>

<p>A few moments later I tip-toed softly out of the
church and left the old man happy with Jesus of
Nazareth, the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>Frequently, since I have come home, when I relate
some of the wonderful ways of the Master with these
soldier lads people say to me: “Ah, Father, they came
back to the sacraments because they were afraid.”</p>

<p>To me, who have witnessed these miracles of God’s
grace, such words always sound harsh, and I then try
to explain to the people what these men really went
through. I describe the long vigil in the muddy front
line trench during the cold, silent hours of the night,
when there was much time to think. Perhaps for
the first time in years some men began to do a little
serious thinking. Under ordinary circumstances, when
the voice of conscience speaks, one has a thousand
ways of deafening the ears. In the trenches there was
no means of silencing the still, small voice. All things
conspired to make one think seriously of death and
the fragility of human life. It was these thoughts
mostly that brought so many men back to God. He
spoke to them and they heard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>I remember once having explained this state of
things to an old woman who had said to me that the
men came through fear. I had done my best to convince
her that the reason the men came was that they
had grown serious under hardship. She looked at me
calmly and knowingly, and said: “That’s it, Father!
They were afraid!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Vague Unrest</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The spring was drawing near, and a certain vague
feeling of unrest was over the troops. Word was being
passed about that old Fritz was preparing for
something. On our side there were no visible preparations
for a spring offensive.</p>

<p>And so the lads were restless. Very often, when
the wind was favorable, large enemy toy-balloons
floated high over our lines, and as the long piece of
smouldering hemp attached to each balloon burned up
to a knotted cord, a package of propaganda articles
was released and a great flock of fluttering leaflets
came slowly down through the air, falling at last among
the troops in the back areas. Usually these articles
told of a big offensive that was to begin and went on
to say that as the Germans had no hatred for the
Canadians, and as they saw no reason for the Canadians
taking part in this war, they advised them not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to take part in it any longer. I remember one batch
of leaflets gave us just seventy-two hours to get out
of the war. Although we laughed at such propaganda,
we were undeniably restless. For instance, we were
especially watchful till the seventy-two hours had
passed. We knew Fritz was going to strike, but we
did not know when or where.</p>

<p>Just about the middle of March we moved out to
Hersin, a little town about three miles from Fosse-dix,
to rest. I was billeted with the curé, a most lovable
man, to whose house was attached a large garden.
There were a few peach trees in the garden and they
were already in bloom.</p>

<p>While at Hersin I was able to help the curé of
Fosse-dix by going to one of his adopted parishes,
Bouvigny, about five miles from where I was billeted.
While taking breakfast with him, he showed me a
small photo of the interior of the church at Bouvigny
after a recent bombardment. Half the church seemed
to be filled with broken beams and pillars, and looking
out from the debris, untouched in any way, was an
almost life-size statue of the Blessed Virgin. I was
struck by the serene, calm expression of Our Lady,
but this seemingly miraculous preservation of statues
and crucifixes was a common occurrence on the Western
Front.</p>

<p>Just before I left a number of airplanes hummed by
overhead, and casually I asked the curé if he had ever
been up in an airplane. He surprised me by saying
he had, during some great public event at Paris. When
he had reached solid earth again after his flight, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
society lady, standing nearby, had said: “Now, my
Father, you will know the way to heaven!” He had
replied, he said: “Yes, Madame, and whenever you
wish to know the way to heaven, I will be very pleased
to teach you it.”</p>

<p>That was the last time I ever saw the little curé
of Fosse-dix, for on Thursday, March 21st, something
happened and we were ordered back suddenly to
Mazingarbe. I remember the date very well for it
was the Feast of St. Benedict and my birthday.</p>

<p>The unrest was no longer vague.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Great Offensive</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Old Fritz” had struck at a vital part of the Allied
front, planning nothing less than a separation of the
French and British armies. He was attacking on a
sixty-three mile front. He had “opened up” with a
terrific bombardment; it was no ordinary barrage, but
one he had been preparing for weeks. He had begun
the bombardment at five o’clock, a. m., and before
noon had broken through the British line in many
places.</p>

<p>For four or five days we waited in Mazingarbe; the
whole First Canadian Division was now standing to
arms ready to go whenever they might be needed.
Every morning from four o’clock till nearly seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the Third Brigade was “standing to” on the square,
fully equipped for battle; for it was always just before
dawn that attacks were made. Fritz did not
attack on our front, but on Wednesday, the 27th, orders
came for us to march.</p>

<p>I left Mazingarbe at about two o’clock for our assembly
area, which was Chateau de la Haie. I arrived there
about four o’clock to find every battalion of the Third
Brigade quartered in the huts about the chateau. On
learning that we were going to be here till ten o’clock,
p. m., I immediately went around to all the orderly
rooms and announced confessions. There was a tiny
house on the grounds that had once been a private oratory;
the stretcher-bearers were quartered here, but
on hearing that I wished to have the use of it, they
very kindly gave it over to me for four hours. I
heard confessions here for the time allotted, then
when it was time for the occupiers of the hut to prepare
for departing I stepped outside, still wearing my
purple stole, and stood under a tree, near which were
tethered horses. There was a long line of soldiers
waiting. Each man walked up, told his little story,
received absolution as he stood there under the stars,
then passed on a few paces to say his penance, while
the next in line moved up. For a long time I stood
there while soldiers, going and coming, passed along
the road near which the men were in line.</p>

<p>At midnight long lines of hooded motor lorries
glided over smooth roads from three different directions
towards Acq. On coming to the point where the
roads crossed they came slowly to a stop; then thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of soldiers who had been sitting or standing
along the roads began quickly to “embus.”</p>

<p>We waited for almost an hour, till the last lorry had
moved off, then I fell in with the transport section.
I could have gone in one of the lorries, but I wished to
go with the transport section as then I might be in a
better position to watch the movements of the whole
brigade.</p>

<p>We went south, marching all through the night. It
was a beautiful moonlight night. We went up hill
and down hill, and always before us moved the long
irregular line of the transport. There were vehicles
of almost every description—limbers, general service
wagons, “mulligan batteries,” the “pill cart,” (which
was a two-wheeled affair with a red cross painted on
either side of the hood), mess cart, water cart, etc.
We passed through one silent moonlit village after
another, sometimes halting to rest awhile. Now and
again an upstairs window opened cautiously, and a
night-capped head peeped over the window-sill at the
long line of the transport resting in the village street.
Towards the dawn we were passing through a beautiful
countryside in which were many old stone chateaux,
built far back from the main road, with green
fields bordered by high trees before them.</p>

<p>For the past six or seven days we had not been
having very much sleep, and as daylight began to
break I began to feel very weary; once or twice while
actually marching I fell asleep, only to be awakened
by falling against the man marching before me.</p>

<p>Often during the night, as we reached the crest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
some hill, we could see the yellow flashes of shrapnel
as it burst in the air, and always we were drawing
nearer. But with the dawn we seemed to have drawn
away from the war area; for now there was neither
sign nor sound of the enemy guns. Whenever we
stopped to rest, men would crawl into the ditches or
lie down near a hedge-row or an open field and go to
sleep. Once in a sunken road I noticed a number of
cyclists sleeping; they were leaning against the high
banks which sloped upwards and away from the road.
There was just enough slope to the banks to see that
they were not standing. Their faces were almost
black from the road dust. On two or three bicycles
were strapped large wicker baskets, and in each basket
hopped about two or three carrier pigeons. These
were to be used in an emergency.</p>

<p>In an open field a number of men from the transport
sections were preparing breakfast, their horses
drawn up on the side of the road, busy with their
nose-bags, and the odor of frying bacon was wafted
on the morning air. We did not breakfast, as we had
no rations with us. Two general service wagons with
rations for the whole battalion were to join us farther
on.</p>

<p>Once, on leaving a quaint little village grouped about
a small, perhaps century-old stone church, we caught
a glimpse of a wide stretch of green countryside. We
had been ascending a hill for quite a distance before
coming to the village. The ground mists had cleared
and the sun was out. From different directions, but
converging towards the same point, were a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
of white roads along which were moving or resting
the long, irregular lines of transport sections from
many different battalions. Just for an instant everything
seemed to be changed. I thought I was back in
my own peaceful country and that I was looking at
a wonderful assembling of gipsy caravans. Up in the
clear air a small bird soared singing its blithe, carefree
song. It was the first time I had ever heard a
lark. The joyous melody seemed but to emphasize the
fantasy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly my dream vanished and I was back
to France, sitting on the roadside on the 28th day of
March, 1918, tired, sleepy and hungry, wondering at
about what time we would meet the oncoming German
army!</p>

<p>When towards noon we entered a little town called
Couturelle, word was passed along the line that we
were going to halt here. I had just finished saying
to George that I should not care to have to make the
march over again when I noticed the quartermaster
of the Thirteenth Battalion come galloping up the
road, smiling and calling out: “We’ve come to the
wrong place.” He waved his crop to me as he passed,
saying: “We have to go back to the Arras area,
Padre!”</p>

<p>I looked in wonder at George. We had left the
Arras front last night towards midnight. I had just
said I should not care to make the march over again.
Now we were to do so!</p>

<p>We came to a halt in an open part of the village,
and there we had lunch; perhaps I should say breakfast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
After the meal I went down to the little church
to make a visit. When I came back all the men were
sleeping. I then lay down in the ditch, put my haversack
under my head, and although it was the 28th of
March I was soon sound asleep. In about two hours
we were awakened.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Agnez-lez-Duisans</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I did not walk back to the Arras front. I went in
a lorry. As we drew near our destination I was surprised
to see so much traffic—but it was all coming
towards us. At every cross-road we were stopped by
the traffic police, just as one might be stopped in a
large city. It was the first time I had ever witnessed
a retreat. Great stores were in Arras belonging to
the military and the British Expeditionary Force canteens.
Most of these stores were being removed, and
the city of Arras, as well as the country villages near
it, was being evacuated.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had seen the effect of war on combatants
only. Now I was continually passing scenes
that made me turn sick at heart; for all along our way
came little groups of French peasants—mostly old
and young women, and children, though now and
again an old man was passed. Sometimes a yoke of
oxen, hitched to a large farm wagon, were guided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the right of the road by a woman or young boy. And
sometimes an old woman led a cow or calf, while an
old man pushed a large wheel-barrow full of bedding.
Once, while we stopped at a cross-road, I tried to study
the faces of those who passed. On no face did I see
the marks of any great strain or fear. All were attired
in their Sunday garments. None of the children cried
or seemed hysterical. All had a good color, and their
large eyes looked solemnly about at the strange scenes
surrounding them; but not one of them hopped or
jumped or smiled at us. The expression in their faces
was one that I noticed in those of the older people. I
can only describe it as one of stolidity. Here were
these people leaving homes where perhaps whole generations
of them had lived, going they knew not where,
leaving behind them many things of value; but they
must sleep on the way and the nights were cold, therefore
they had all brought bedding along with them.
For the first time since I had enlisted I recalled a
short and succinct definition of war given by General
Sherman. “General Sherman was right,” I said
grimly.</p>

<p>Presently we came into a little village, at the entrance
of which was a large Calvary on the roadside, the great
white figure drooping from the cross in agony. Tomorrow
would be His day. Perhaps it was the continual
passing of these wayside Calvarys that gave
patience to the peasantry. I was glad when the driver
told me that this was our destination.</p>

<p>The lorry stopped before a large camp of Nissen
huts. A gentle mist had been falling for the last hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
or two, but now it was developing into quite a drizzle.
I walked across the muddy square, then down a little
lane through rows of huts till I found my billet. In
one part of the hut the rain was leaking through the
roof, but I did not mind this. There were no berths,
but we had our bed-rolls and all that was necessary
was to roll them out on the floor. I had been sleeping
on floors now, from time to time, for over a year and
I cannot say that it ever inconvenienced me very much.
Just as I was leaving the hut to go to the church to
make a visit—for it was Holy Thursday—two Scotch
Highlanders accosted me. They wished to know to
which battalion I belonged. When I told them, they
became very friendly and told me that they had just
come from the Front. Fritz had pushed them back
a little that morning, but they had been holding him
since dinner-time. This was good news, and I hoped
that Fritz would continue to be held.</p>

<p>I had been praying before the lighted repository in
the village church for a few minutes when I heard
footsteps coming, then I felt a hand touch me on the
shoulder, then a military chaplain walked by me into
the sacristy. I followed him. When he turned, I
recognized him immediately. It was Father Christopher
Sheehan, an Irish chaplain whom I had met at
St. Michael’s Club, London, just about a year before.
He had come to London to receive the Military Cross
from King George of England.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Father?” he asked. I smiled
and told him his name and when and where I had met
him; also what I was doing there and when I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
come. When I had finished his brown eyes lighted up
pleasantly, as with the enthusiasm of a boy he began
to tell me that I was “in luck.” For he was billeted
at a convent school and had charge of all the livestock
on the premises. Then Father Sheehan went on to
prove that I was “in luck;” and as he enumerated all
the articles he had at his disposal, I quite agreed with
him. The Sisters had left him bottles and bottles of
preserved pears, peaches, and strawberries, many different
kinds of vegetables and a large number of
hares, etc. His eyes sparkled with delight at the
thought of being able to share his good things with
some one. He looked at his wrist-watch; it was nearly
six o’clock. “Dinner-time,” he said, “Father, come!”</p>

<p>I followed him up the road, thanking God that I had
fallen in with this warm-hearted Irish priest. On the
way he told me that the lad with him was an excellent
cook. I think the way the good things disappeared
that evening was sufficient evidence of my appreciation
of his culinary art. Yes, gentle reader, it was
Lent—but, then, you know it was war time!</p>

<p>Just as we had finished George came in; but he was
scarcely in till he found himself seated at the table
that Father Sheehan and I had just vacated, and presently
the cook and George had set to work. They
went at it earnestly, carefully, and methodically, giving
it all attention. The cook had prepared an enormous
quantity of potatoes; an ordinary vegetable dish
would have been too small to hold them all, so they
were piled high in a large white milk basin. Father
Sheehan and I had decreased the pile considerably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
but now under the skillful treatment of George and
the cook the remainder disappeared with extraordinary
rapidity. It was good to watch the lads; they worked
with such dispatch and so whole-heartedly. It was a
wonderful example of the adage, “What you have to
do, do it well,” and I felt loath to leave when Father
Sheehan asked me to come with him to one of the
class-rooms.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Refugees</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Father Sheehan, opening the door of the class-room,
stood back for me to enter. I did, and then fell back
in surprise, for the little class-room was almost filled
with French civilians and piles of bedding. The seven
or eight little children looked wide-eyed at me, but
they smiled brightly when they saw Father Sheehan.
The older people greeted me simply, as is the way of
the French peasant with the stranger.</p>

<p>They were refugees from Dainville and were stopping
at the convent over night. Tomorrow, Good Friday,
they were to continue their sorrowful journey.
They were mostly women, though there was one old
man among them who did most of the talking. He
seemed somewhat apologetic as to his position. “Do
you think,” he said to me, “that if it were not for
these women and children I would be here? I, sir,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
would stay to meet the enemy. In 1870 I was a soldier
in the army of France, and I was a prisoner of war,
but now I must look after these women and children.”</p>

<p>I expressed my sympathy with the old soldier and
asked him a few questions about the Franco-Prussian
war of 1870. When I had finished, he looked at me
keenly. “You, monsieur, you are an Englishman?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, “I am a Canadian, chaplain to
the Canadian soldiers.”</p>

<p>The keen look in the old man’s eyes became more
intense as they searched my face. “Ah!” he said with
a slow intake of breath. “Ah!” he repeated. Then he
stood erect. “The soldiers of Canada are good soldiers,”
he half-shouted.</p>

<p>As I bowed my appreciation of his praise, he turned
and spoke to the women, but his words were uttered
so rapidly that I could not catch their sense.</p>

<p>Presently he turned to me again, and there was a
bright, hopeful look in his eyes. “Are the Canadians
going to remain here?” he asked. I said I thought
we were, for we had come to stop the German advance.
I did not add “if we are able,” for I wished to give
him courage. “Ah!” the old man said again.</p>

<p>The next morning as I came down to the convent to
breakfast I met a great number of refugees, only this
time instead of leaving their homes they were returning
to them. Almost in the lead of the procession,
pushing a wheel-barrow stacked high with bedding
came the old man that I had talked with the previous
evening. He greeted me warmly, as did the women;
the little children smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“We are returning home,” the old man said. “I
don’t think the enemy will advance any farther now.”</p>

<p>As I left him and his companions and turned in towards
the gates of the convent, I felt a great gladness
coming over me. Yesterday these poor people were
going out from their homes; but since then the Canadian
lads had come and now were lined up between the
homes of these French peasants and the enemy. These
people knew the Canadian soldiers, so they were going
back to their homes.</p>

<p>I felt proud of my Canadian lads.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LVI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Arras</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>That afternoon, accompanied by Father Sheehan, I
went up to Arras to visit my brigade, for most of the
soldiers were billeted in the city. Arras was being
heavily shelled by the enemy. Long before we reached
the suburbs we could see the sudden spurts of black
smoke rising in many places from large buildings;
and as we drew nearer we could hear the dull, quick-echoing
crash as shell after shell shrieked its way into
the great chalk buildings and exploded. Our own field
artillery was busy on the outskirts of the town, returning
the German fire. A fine mist of rain fell.</p>

<p>It is extremely hard to describe the strange, unfamiliar
depression that came over one entering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
city; for everything was silent, save when a shell
shrieked horribly and then burst, while almost simultaneously
came the sound of falling stone and mortar
and the tinkle of broken glass. Nobody walked in
the silent streets; and in the great empty dilapidated
buildings there was no movement, save now and then
the flutter of torn window-blind or soiled curtain in
some empty window-frame. In one part of the city
blood was mingled with the rain water that ran slowly
along the gutter.</p>

<p>We came to the giant statue of Neptune, which faced
us and divided our street. We followed the street
which ran to our left, passed the Monument and presently
were at the hospital of St. John, which was in
charge of some French nuns—I think they were of
the Augustinian Order. They had given over one large
wing of their hospital to the Canadians, who were
using it as an advance dressing station.</p>

<p>There was a really beautiful chapel attached to this
hospital, and there was an English military chaplain
quartered near it, who said Mass there every morning.
I arranged with him to have the use of the chapel on
Easter Sunday to say Mass for my lads, but when on
Saturday I went to Brigade Headquarters, which was
in Arras, to announce the hours of service I was told
that there would be no church parades, as the shelling
was so continuous that no congregating of the men
above ground would be permitted. The battalions of
the Third Brigade were scattered in different billets
throughout the city. I was very sorry I could not have
the men for Easter Sunday, but since it would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
endangered their lives, I recognized the wisdom of the
order. Before I left the city that evening there was
not the slightest doubt in my mind but that the brigade
officers had acted with great prudence, for I was the
only one on the long road leading out of Arras, save
occupants of an ambulance which came screeching up
the road, passing me with terrific speed. When its
sound had died away I became more than ever aware
of the shells that dropped so perilously near that I
could hear the splinters falling on the cobbles just
behind me.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Easter Sunday</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Since I could not have a parade of my men at Arras
I decided to do what good I could at Agnez-lez-Duisans.
We had early Mass for the civil population, and as
their curé was serving in the army I acted as parish
priest that morning. Following my ordination to the
priesthood I had been sent, as assistant priest, to a
parish where French only was spoken. For three years
I ministered to these people and when I had left them
I felt that I had a fair working knowledge of their
language, though when I first went among them, I
received quite a shock. During my classical course
I had studied the French language for four years; my
theological course had been made at the Grand Seminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of Quebec, where the great majority of the students
were French-Canadians. I had left the Seminary
thinking that I had an adequate knowledge of the
French language; nevertheless, I took a whole week to
prepare and memorize my first French sermon in the
little parish. I entered the pulpit a little fearful,
though when I found my words flowing with no great
effort I warmed to the work. I went down to the altar
feeling that I had done fairly well; but after Mass,
while receiving a Mass offering from a gentle old lady
who had come into the sacristy leaning on a cane, I
asked her very simply how I had preached. I shall
never forget the kindly look with which the old lady
regarded me, as she said: “It was all right, Father,
all right! We all knew what you were trying to say.”
And I had been preparing for eight years! However,
when I left these good people I think they used to
know what I was saying. And this Easter morning,
in far-away France, as peasant after peasant came to
me to confession, I recalled these golden days of my
early service for the Master when the first fervor of
the young priest was strongly aglow and all the world
was at peace.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I took Holy Communion to an
old woman who was an invalid and could not come to
the church. Everything was spotlessly prepared and
all the people knelt reverently when I entered the
house bearing the Divine Guest. I tried to tip-toe softly
in my big heavy military boots, but as they were built
for marching on long roads I did not succeed very well.
It seemed very strange there in the soft, carpeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
room; two or three women knelt near the bedside; the
feminine touch was everywhere; for the first time since
my enlistment I felt the lack of cassock and surplice.
Somehow, I felt a little awkward. She was an old
woman, and her life must have been a very holy one.
Simply and with great faith she received the Divine
Guest and I knew Our Lord would feel at home.</p>

<p>When I was leaving one of the women pressed into
my hand a five-franc piece. It was the first I had ever
seen; but when I wished to return it, the woman
seemed determined that I should keep it. I did—as
a souvenir.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Ronville Caves</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>On Wednesday morning while I was taking my
breakfast in the mess of the Sixteenth Battalion, George
came in with a cup of tea and some good news. All
the battalions of the brigade were quartered in the
Ronville caves—over three thousand men underground.
This was, indeed, good news, for now I could
do some work among the men, which I had been longing
to do.</p>

<p>The Ronville caves were just beyond the railway
station, under the outskirts of Arras. Nearly all the
buildings of the city, including the Cathedral of Arras,
were built of chalk. This chalk had been quarried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
from the depths of the earth, as near as possible to the
city. When all the chalk necessary had been excavated,
lo! there remained the chalk caves of Ronville—a
series of caves at the end of short tunnels that
branched off from a great main tunnel miles in length.</p>

<p>After breakfast I went down to the convent and
found Father Sheehan seated in his dining-room. Yes,
he knew well the situation of the Ronville caves and
would be only too pleased to accompany me to them.
In a few minutes we were on our way to Arras. We
went through the city, turned to our right just before
we came to the railway station, passed over the iron
overhead bridge crossing the railway tracks, turned a
little to our left, and presently we were walking
through a quadrangle, pitted deeply with old and new
shell-holes, towards the entrance of the caves.</p>

<p>We passed through the opening and almost immediately
were in complete darkness. We stumbled along
for a little, I happening to be in the lead, then suddenly
a long shaft of light shot silently ahead of me,
illuminating the long white chalk corridor. Father
Sheehan’s small flash-light was at work. Then as we
came around a curve in our road we heard from far
down in the corridor a muffled complaint; our light
was shining in the eyes of some poor oncomer; so immediately
we were in darkness again, though far down
the corridor, seemingly attached to the wall, a light as
from a candle glimmered. We advanced slowly, Father
Sheehan flashing his lamp intermittently on the ground
just ahead.</p>

<p>I visited all the battalions except the Thirteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
and had arranged to have the men come to confession
and Holy Communion the following day, when we almost
collided with two kilted officers in the Thirteenth
Battalion tartan. One was the chaplain of the battalion,
then Captain Graham, M. C., (afterwards Major
Graham, M. C., D. S. O.) a Presbyterian, a brave soldier
and a thorough gentleman; the other was a young
Catholic officer who had but lately returned to his
battalion after having been wounded. They had been
looking for me. Captain Graham introduced the young
officer, who was Captain E. Waud, and then left us.
Captain Waud began very gently yet firmly to take me
to task; “You have not been giving us an opportunity
lately to go to confession, Father,” he said.</p>

<p>I jumped interiorly, for this was the first time I
had been accused of not giving the men every opportunity
of approaching the sacraments, but I liked that
young officer then and there.</p>

<p>“Well, captain,” I said, “no later than last Wednesday
night I stood under a tree in Chateau de la
Haie waiting for all the soldiers who might come; the
Fourteenth and Sixteenth showed up well, but many
of the Thirteenth did not show up.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “we were at a concert that evening!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I returned, “I had announced confessions
before supper, and if the men missed the opportunity
of going by attending a concert it was not my fault.
However,” I continued, “I have just announced confessions
for tomorrow at all the battalion orderly rooms,
excepting the Thirteenth. I am on my way there now.”</p>

<p>The young officer seemed very pleased, and promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to have all the Catholic soldiers of his company in
New Plymouth cave the following morning at ten
o’clock. “God bless you!” I said to him. “If all my
Catholic officers were as eager to come to confession,
and bring their men, as you are, my work would be
made very much easier.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Banquet Hall</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following morning after breakfast Father Sheehan
and I went down on our bicycles to the parish
church. Then each of us, wearing a white stole over
our uniform, went to the little tabernacle and after
genuflecting silently, took from it one small military
ciborium full of consecrated Hosts. Then silently we
left the church bearing our precious burden.</p>

<p>When we entered Arras, which was now known as
the “City of the Dead,” we found, as usual, empty
streets and the contour of many sections of the city
fast disappearing under the unceasing bombardment
of German guns.</p>

<p>We left our bicycles in care of the guard on the
bridge near the entrance to the Ronville caves and
walked through the quadrangle, which contained many
more shell-holes than it did on our previous visit. For
this reason our passage was made very quickly. The
long main tunnel was much better lighted, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
lighted candles being attached at intervals on either
wall. We turned to our right and entered a subsidiary
tunnel, above the entrance of which was a sign-board
bearing the names of three or four different
caves, New Plymouth was one to which the tunnel led.</p>

<p>New Plymouth was wide and low, and although
one of the smaller caves, could very easily accommodate
comfortably five or six hundred men. At one end
farthest from the entrance was what proved to be an
excellent altar table. The chalk had been quarried
in such a manner that what appeared to be a large
chalk altar remained. Father Sheehan and I looked
at each other in some surprise; then placed our Sacred
Burden on the altar, covered the two ciboriums with
a small white cloth we had brought, and lighted two
candles which we placed on either side—we had
brought our pockets filled with small pieces of candles
from the church. We then sat down on our steel helmets,
placed on piles of chalk, for already we could
hear the sound of many voices coming along the corridor.
Presently a large crowd of men from the Fifteenth
and Sixteenth entered the dimly-lighted cave,
removed their caps, genuflected before the altar and
then knelt in little groups on the hard chalk floor,
silent in prayer—for the Lord was in His holy temple!</p>

<p>Quickly the men came to confession, and every ten
or fifteen minutes either Father Sheehan or I stood
up, went to the altar while some soldier said the “Confiteor;”
then as the little white cloth was passed from
one soldier to another they received with deep reverence
their Lord. As each little semi-circle of men received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Holy Communion, they moved back into the
more darkened portion of the cave where they knelt
to make their thanksgiving.</p>

<p>We had been dispensing “the mysteries of God”
for nearly an hour when a large number from the
Thirteenth came in and knelt down near me. Just before
them knelt their young captain. He had done as
he had said; all his Catholic lads were with him.
For a long time they knelt there on the hard chalk
floor, and as now and again my eyes fell on the earnest
faces of the lads as they prayed reverently, my
thoughts would go back to the early ages of the church
when the first Christians adored God in the Catacombs
of Rome.</p>

<p>In a little while I gave the young officer and his lads
Holy Communion. At the time there seemed to me
to be some earnestness about the young captain—as
if this communion were a great and holy preparation
for some event that I knew nothing of. While he
knelt back in the gloom, silently returning thanks to
God, I could not help associating him with the knights
of old. Then when he had finished his thanksgiving,
strengthened by the coming of the Lord, he left the
cave at the head of his men, ready, like a true knight,
for whatever was to come.</p>

<p>All day we worked in the Banquet Hall; all day
long, with the exception of one or two short intervals,
came the banqueters. At about half-past twelve a
soldier came quickly into the cave calling loudly, “R.
C. chaplain!” I stood up and went in the direction
from which the voice had come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Quick, sir!” said the soldier. “The M. O. of the
Fourteenth says one of your men is hit and for you
to come quick.” Without delay I followed my guide
down the tunnel till we came to the medical aid post
of the Fourteenth. There, lying on a table with the
doctor of the Fourteenth Battalion working over him
was one of the Catholic lads of the Thirteenth bleeding
in many places from a number of wounds. He
had stepped out from the cave for a minute and had
been caught in the enemy fire. “Is it long since you’ve
been to confession, lad?” I said. He looked at me
through clear eyes, though he was in great pain. “Just
about an hour ago, Father,” he said. The doctor
whispered in my ear, “He’s going, Padre,” so I put
on my stole and prepared the lad for death. I always
carried the Holy Oils in my pocket. Just as I finished
anointing the dying soldier one of his friends was admitted
for a last word.</p>

<p>“What will I tell your people at home?” asked the
friend, who was a Protestant.</p>

<p>“Tell them—” he labored a little for breath—“tell
them,” he repeated, “I had the priest!”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he was taken by ambulance to
the Field Ambulance at Agnez-lez-Duisans, and the
following morning he died.</p>

<p>I returned to New Plymouth cave and there I found
Father Sheehan very busy, for the Fourteenth Battalion
was now coming. We heard them quickly, however,
as it was but a few days since they had come
to confession at Chateau de la Haie.</p>

<p>That evening, after the last man had left, Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Sheehan came over to me. “Father,” he said, “wasn’t
it a great day’s work?”</p>

<p>I could scarcely speak for the great joy I felt.
There had been such consolation throughout the whole
day! Great things had been done for our Divine Lord,
who had waited all day long in the dimly-lighted cave,
giving His deep, sweet peace to the souls of these lads
of “good will.” Centuries before He had come to
another cave, when “glad tidings” had been announced
to the shepherds.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” I said, “it was one of the happiest
days of my life.”</p>

<p>Then, simultaneously, we thought of the things of
earth. It was time to go back to Agnez-lez-Duisans,
for, with the exception of one slice of bread and margarine
between us, we had eaten nothing since early
morning. It was now evening.</p>

<p>The following morning while at breakfast a letter
from headquarters was given to me by the waiter. I
opened it quickly: It read, “Capt. the Rev. R. M.
Crochetiere was killed in action April 2nd, near Bailleulmont.”
This place was just a little to the south
of Arras. Not a year before he had sung the great
open-air Mass at Witley Camp when the Catholic soldiers
had been consecrated to the Sacred Heart. Just
yesterday he had gone home to the Sacred Heart to
receive the reward of his stewardship. I sat back
from the breakfast table and wondered who would
be next. Then I went down to the convent.</p>

<p>Almost every morning I went down to the convent,
for there was a lovely garden there where I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
walk up and down under the trees and read my Breviary.
Often as I passed through the court before
the main building, on my way to the garden, I paused
before a beautiful statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
The base of the statue was surrounded by a wide
circle of green lawn, bordering which was a fringe of
forget-me-nots, planted very likely by the good Sisters
as a symbol of their devotion to the Sacred Heart.
Every morning the children whom the Sisters taught
before they went away came to the convent and asked
a young woman—a kind of lay-Sister who came daily
to do some work about the building—when the Sisters
were coming back. “Very soon, perhaps—tomorrow,
perhaps.” And the little ones would stay
through the morning and play till they were tired;
then they would sit on the low benches and sing in
their sweet childish voices the beautiful hymns that
the Sisters had taught them.</p>

<p>The presence of the sky-blue, yellow-centered forget-me-nots
always brought to my mind the love of the
Sisters for the Sacred Heart; the sound of the children’s
voices in the morning always brought to my
mind the love of the children for the Sisters.</p>

<p>Just beyond the convent, on the other side of the
Scarpe River, which here was only about six feet wide,
was a group of Nissen huts that had up to a few
weeks before been used as a Casualty Clearing Station,
but at the beginning of the German advance the patients
and staff had been removed. Now it was being
used by a Field Ambulance for dressing wounds or
some emergency operation of casualties from the Arras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
front. Father Whiteside, an English chaplain, was
on duty here, though usually he called me when
any of my Canadian lads came in. Across the road
from the Field Ambulance was a large military cemetery
where regiments of weary soldiers rested softly,
each under the shadow of a little white cross.</p>

<p>It was the following Sunday afternoon that I had
my first burials in this cemetery. At two o’clock a
procession of soldiers, mostly kilted laddies from the
Thirteenth, came slowly up the long aisle of the cemetery:
in the lead, following the pipe band that played
the “Flowers of the Forest,” walked nine groups of
six men, each carrying shoulder high, one of their late
comrades who had answered bravely the last call.
One was an officer, the young knight who had passed
his vigil in New Plymouth cave. While leading his
men out of the Ronville caves he had been mortally
wounded, passing away a few hours afterwards. Of
the dead, only Captain Waud and the young soldier
from the Thirteenth whom I had anointed in the cave,
were Catholics.</p>

<p>And often as I passed through the court before the
main building of the convent and paused to look at
the sweet forget-me-nots fringing the lawn around
the base of the statue of the Sacred Heart, I recalled
the two who, among others, had remembered their
Creator, and I felt now they were not forgotten:
“Turn to Me and I will turn to thee,” had said the
Lord.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Sheehans</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We waited at Agnez-lez-Duisans a few days longer,
but “old Fritz” did not strike on the Arras front,
though all the world knows that he continued to gain
elsewhere. Two or three times during the week,
Father Sheehan went up to Arras with a quantity
of provisions to two Poor Clare Sisters who lived on
in the basement of their ruined convent in order to
pay court to their King.</p>

<p>In the evening we were kept busy hearing confessions
and giving Holy Communion to soldiers in the
parish church. One evening when we had heard the
confessions of all the men present, I stepped into the
sacristy to say a word to Father Sheehan, who was
just going out to give Holy Communion.</p>

<p>“Ah, Father!” he said in his gentle, friendly manner,
“I am glad you came in. Will you please go
down there to Pat and tell him not to go to Communion
now. You see, Father, he was there this
morning, and he’s such a pious lad that when he sees
the others going to the rails, he might forget that he
was there this morning and go up again.”</p>

<p>“All right, Father,” I said, but somehow or other
I found great difficulty in suppressing a strong inclination
to smile as I walked down the flagged aisle of
the church. Pat—Father Sheehan had pointed him
out to me—who was intently reading his prayer-book,
looked up kindly at me as I drew near. “God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
bless you, Father,” he whispered, as I stooped over
him and he disposed himself elaborately to listen. It
actually pained me to keep from laughing as I prepared
to deliver my message.</p>

<p>“Pat,” I said, “Father Sheehan sent me to tell
you not to go to Communion again. He is afraid
that you might forget you were there this morning
and go back again.”</p>

<p>Pat just looked at his book and shook his head as
he smiled indulgently. Then he looked at me, still
smiling, “Shure, Father dear, I had no intention of
going again!” Then he said, as if to himself, “God
bless Father Sheehan!”</p>

<p>Pat’s words were echoed strongly in my heart; for
every one that met Father Sheehan would feel like
wishing him the very best they could, and what is
better than the blessing of God?</p>

<p>Just about this time I received from my mother a
birthday present, which had been delayed along the
way. It was a large volume entitled “Canon Sheehan
of Doneraile,” by Father Heuser. I had long enjoyed
the works of the gentle Canon, and I had always
felt that I owed a lot to this seer and prophet.
I had long wanted to read the life of one who had made
many such unerring prophesies as the following some
twenty years before the signing of the Armistice:</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the new Paganism, called modern
civilization, is working out its own destruction and
solving its own problems. There are subterranean
mutterings of a future upheaval that will change the
map of the world as effectually as did an irruption of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Vandals or Visigoths. In the self-degradation of
women; in the angry disputes between Labor and
Capital; in the dreams of Socialists, and the sanguinary
ambitions of Nihilists; in the attitude of the great
Powers to each other, snarling and afraid to bite; in
the irreverence and flippancy of the age manifested
towards the most sacred and solemn subjects, in the
destructive attempts of philosophers, in the elimination
of the supernatural, in the concentration of all human
thought upon the fleeting concerns of this life,
and the covert, yet hardly concealed, denial of a life
to come; in the rage for wealth, in the almost insane
dread of poverty—and all these evil things permeating
and penetrating into every class—there is
visible to the most ordinary mortal a disintegration of
society that can only eventuate in such ruin as have
made Babylon and Nineveh almost historical myths,
and has made a proverb and by-word even of Imperial
Rome. Where is the remedy? Clearly, Christianity;
and still more clearly the only Christianity that is
possible, and can bear the solvent influence of the new
civilization. Nothing but the poverty of Christ, manifested
in the self-abandonment of our religious communities;
the awful purity of Christ, continued in a
celibate priesthood and the white sanctity of our nuns;
the self-denial and immolation of Christ, shown again
wherever the sacrificial instinct is manifested in our
martyrs and missionaries; the love of Christ, as exhibited
in our charge of the orphaned, the abandoned,
the profligate, the diseased, the leprous and insane—can
lead back the vast masses of erring humanity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the condition not only of stability, but of the fruition
of perfect peace. For what is the great political maxim
of government but the greatest good to the greatest
number—in other words, the voluntary sacrifice of
the individual for the welfare of the Commonwealth?
And where is that seen but in the ranks of the obscure
and hidden, the unknown and despised (unknown and
despised by themselves above all) members of the
Catholic church.”</p>

<p>I took the book down to the convent to show it to
Father Sheehan. To my question if he had ever met
Canon Sheehan, looking at me in that quizzical half
smiling way that one regards a questioner when the
information to be given far exceeds that asked, he
said: “Yes, I have met him. I knew him, and he was
my cousin.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Ecoivres</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>April was passing quickly. Very early in the morning,
from the old trees about the convent, one heard
the sweet, clear call of many birds; the leaves were
unfolding; the fresh, revivifying odors of new grass
and early spring flowers were in the air. All around
us were signs of destruction by the ingenuity of man;
yet nature was steadfastly following her laws, restoring,
expanding, and quickening to new life—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
cheering wonderfully many tired and war-weary men.</p>

<p>On all sides Fritz was making advances, but we
were holding him at Arras. I made frequent visits
to this City of the Dead, and every time I passed
through its gates—Arras is a walled city—an appalling
sense of loneliness gripped me. Only seventy
people of the thirty thousand inhabitants remained;
and to see, now and then, a solitary civilian moving
along the street, or about some shattered dwelling-place,
only emphasized the awful stillness. I visited
the ruins of the great cathedral and saw the statue
of Our Lady standing unscathed in her little side
chapel. I walked through the corridors of the shattered
seminary, where for many years young Frenchmen
had walked silently, listening to the voice of the
Spirit of God, forming them for the work of the holy
ministry. The young men who should now be here
were in the trenches, clad in the light-blue uniform
of the soldiers of France.</p>

<p>Not far from the seminary, in the basement of their
shattered convent, lived two Poor Clare nuns who had
remained to adore our Divine Lord on the altar. I
do not know how it had been arranged, but there was
Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in
that poor cellar. Perhaps it was for this reason that
the Canadians held Arras. It was to these holy
women of France that Father Sheehan made many
visits, carrying pieces of meat, rolls of bread, etc.
The quartermaster of the unit from which he drew
rations was an Irishman, and many of the lads gladly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
stinted themselves so that he could lay by a little
food for the Poor Clare Sisters at Arras.</p>

<p>Then, one day just after lunch, orders came to move.
We were not going very far away—only to the little
village of Ecoivres at the base of Mt. St. Eloi, about
five or six kilometers distant. I stayed with Father
Sheehan for tea, and at four o’clock left alone for
Ecoivres. I had never been there before, but Father
Sheehan had given me minute directions and I knew
I would have no difficulty finding the large chateau
of the village.</p>

<p>I had not gone more than a mile on my way when
I noticed shells dropping into many of the little villages
that lay scattered over the green countryside
before me. I must pass through two of these villages
before arriving at my destination. I suspected some
big attack on the part of the Germans, as it was their
invariable custom to shell heavily the back areas In
order to prevent us from bringing up fresh troops.
As I was revolving in my mind how pleasant it was
going to be for me to run the gauntlet of fire, I heard
the terrifying shriek of a shell, and as I turned, was
just in time to see a great black shell burst only a
few feet behind me. A group of men had been standing
on the roadside but not one was hit. I stood for
a few moments dazed by the suddenness of it all,
my ears ringing from the terrible explosion, while
teams drawing general service wagons galloped noisily
by and men ran like startled hares towards points of
safety. Presently I continued my walk, every nerve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
tense, expecting another shell-burst. None came, however.</p>

<p>I passed through the two villages and no shell
dropped near me till I came to the outskirts of
Ecoivres, then shell after shell came screaming through
the air, exploding in the high bank that sloped up
from the roadside. A few soldiers coming behind me
on bicycles dismounted and crouched low as each
one tore its way across our road. I felt sick, dazed
and frightened and whenever the others crouched, I
did also; but we reached the little town in safety.</p>

<p>I passed the church, which was untouched, though
many stone buildings about it were almost completely
demolished. Then I came into the court before the
chateau, where a great number of soldiers were quartered.</p>

<p>It was an old chateau, the ancestral home of a long
line of French counts, which had been commandeered
early in the war. The present owner, however, still
had a room or two allotted to him. I went up an old
winding stairway and walked from the landing along
the hall till I came to a great wide room where a number
of officers of different battalions of my brigade
stood talking in little groups. They greeted me with
true military friendliness, but I could see that they
were restless and ill at ease. Fritz had struck again
and broken the British line, taking many prisoners
and great quantities of supplies. And as the officers
talked, shells screamed into the village.</p>

<p>Just before dinner George came to the mess and
his face lighted up when he saw me. He had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
before me by a different route, and some of his companions—although
none of our own brigade—had
been killed, together with a number of horses. There
was in George’s eye that hurt, dazed look that I was
to see so often in the eyes of men when the shells
screamed by and took toll of their companions. George
told me I was to be billeted in a large room with a
number of other officers. While he was speaking,
however, the billeting officer joined us to say that he
had a fine billet for me; it was a little hut outside in
the grounds. It had been reserved for the colonel,
but as he wished to remain in the chateau, the billeting
officer, remembering that I preferred, when possible,
to have a billet alone, so that the men might
the more easily come to see me, had given me the
little hut.</p>

<p>After dinner, which was late that evening, I went
down through the chateau grounds, crossed a bridge
over a small river that ran through them and followed
the road until I came to a little burlap hut built on
the river bank under the willow trees, that had just
hung out their fresh green draperies. And as I stood
surveying my billet, I became aware that the shelling
had ceased; the stars were coming out; just the faintest
rustle sounded among the tree-tops; there was a
very pleasant tinkle and gurgle from the running
water; from all around the wide green grounds came
the low murmur of talking from groups of soldiers
bivouacked here and there under the trees. George
came up presently with four or five letters and a box
of caramels that had come with the Canadian mail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
It was one of those strange interludes that came fairly
often during the campaign, when one actually forgot
for a little while war and its gruesomeness.</p>

<p>In the morning, after a very pleasant night’s sleep
by the softly running waters, I went down to the
parish church to say Mass. The curé was a large man
and very kind; evidently the billeting officer had tried
to place me with him, for he took great pains to explain
to me that his house was extremely small, and
already it was full on account of the presence of some
of his relations who had been evacuated from the
Arras area.</p>

<p>I told the curé how pleasantly I was situated, and
that the softly running water had sent me to sleep.
He smiled, helped me to put on my vestments and then
served my Mass. After Mass, as I made my thanksgiving
before the altar, I noticed on the Gospel side a
large alcove. In it were five or six prie-dieux, and a
communion rail ran the width of it. It was somewhat
similar to a box in a theatre. On the wall in the alcove
opposite to where I knelt was a large copper slab
bearing the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">To the Memory of<br />
M. Edward Mary Alexander<br />
Viscount of Brandt of Calometz<br />
Died in his castle of Ecoivres<br />
the 9th. October 1894<br />
R. I. P.</p>

<p>I concluded that this was the part of the church
where the people of the chateau came to assist at
Mass in the old days before France printed on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
coins “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.” I saw the
present owner of the estate a few days later, and I
wondered if he sat in the alcove to assist at Mass on
Sundays. He was a tall, heavily built man in old
rough clothes, and looked more like a laborer one
would see sitting idly about the docks. He had a
large, heavy red face and a thick black mustache.
When I saw him first he stood facing a pointed bayonet—though
he kept at least three feet from the
point—and an angry sentry at the entrance to the
chateau was telling him in English that he could not
enter. The owner of the chateau, still more angry
than the guard, shouted in French that he would
enter; that these were his grounds, though his manner
of putting in practice his words resembled more
the advancing of a horse on a treadmill. I was about
to offer my services as interpreter and general peace-maker
when an officer approached the angry guard
and told him that it was the owner of the chateau
whom he was keeping from entering. The guard
sprang to attention, and as the angry owner entered
his grounds looked after him sheepishly. “Well, Holy
Moses!” he exclaimed.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Ecurie Wood</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had expected to stay at Ecoivres for Sunday, and
I had arranged with the curé for the soldiers’ Mass,
but on Saturday orders came for us to move to Ecurie
Wood. It was not very far away, about three miles.
My billet here was a corrugated iron hut, barricaded
without on all sides with sand-bags piled about three
feet high and two wide. There was no floor other
than the natural earth. The seat of a general service
wagon, that very likely had succumbed to Fritz’s shelling,
had been converted into a very serviceable chair;
on a high bedding of mud and rocks was placed horizontally
an empty five-gallon gasoline tin, from which
pointed heavenwards, through the low roof, some
homemade stove pipe. There was no door on this improvised
stove. When I entered the hut a fire of charcoal
and small pieces of wood glowed in the opening
of the tin, which the chair faced. There was no
church near us, but there was a large moving-picture
hut just about two hundred yards away where Mass
was said on Sundays; and only fifty yards from this
was a small square tent, with the words “Catholic
Chapel” painted in black on it, where a priest was
on duty every evening to hear confessions. As there
was no church near where the Blessed Sacrament was
reserved, I now began to carry Our Lord with me.
On Monday I consecrated about two hundred particles
in my small military ciborium, and always, day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
night, in the pocket of my tunic was the little ciborium
where Jesus dwelt. And in the evenings I used to go
down to the chapel-tent, place the ciborium on a corporal
spread out on the rough board table and, saying
a short prayer, sit on an empty box to hear the
confessions of the men who came. We were in a
very exposed territory and shells were continuously
dropping into our area. Sometimes the shells would
come so near us that I would sit on my box, or kneel
before the Blessed Sacrament, trembling, expecting
each moment to be my last.</p>

<p>A great number of men were assembling in the
Ecurie Wood area, and I began to meet many old
friends. Some of the lads who had come overseas
with me were in battalions quartered nearby; and
just over the hill, in the military cemetery of Roclincourt,
Lt. Lawlor, one of my Catholic officers and
a very gallant soldier, slept softly under his white
cross.</p>

<p>The work at Ecurie Wood was very consoling: wonderful
things happened in that little white chapel-tent.
One night a great giant of a man stepped in, and without
any introduction said, simply: “Father, I want
to be christened.” I could not help laughing, for in
my mind always associated with the word “christen”
were thoughts of tiny, white-clad helpless babies being
carried to the baptismal font. But the big giant
did not laugh. It was a very serious matter for him.</p>

<p>I asked him to which religion he belonged. He
said he belonged to none, but that his people had been
Presbyterians. I commenced instructions and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
short time I had the great pleasure of baptizing him
in the little tent.</p>

<p>Sometimes men would come back to the sacraments
after years of absence, and it was wonderful to watch
the effects of Divine Grace in their souls. Often they
would come back to the tent to have a chat and to
speak of some fellow with whom they were trying to
share their own great happiness. Frequently a returned
prodigal would say to me: “Now, Father, I
have a lad outside who hasn’t been to his duties for
many years. I got him to come down tonight. I’m
just telling you this, Father, for he’s got the ‘wind up’
pretty bad, but I know you’ll take him easy, Father.”
Then perhaps a big, slow moving, puzzled figure would
step into the tent, looking around mystified, not knowing
what to do next. Then I would beckon him to
come and kneel down, and then—I would “take him
easy.”</p>

<p>One night, when I was sitting on my box, a large
one placed near me, against which the men might
kneel when telling their little story, a man came rushing
in and knelt so suddenly that he knocked over the
larger box, and then fell on it as it reached the ground.</p>

<p>I stood up quickly, taking off my purple stole as I
did so, and as the poor fellow got slowly up I said:
“What’s the matter? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>He looked at me in a dazed sort of way, and then
over his shoulder towards the open flap of the tent.
“I’m willing to go, Father,” he said.</p>

<p>“I think you’re a little too eager to go,” I said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
“There’s no need, you know, to knock over that box.
I put that there for men to kneel against.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “I’m willing to go, but I want
a little time to get ready. It’s a long time since I was
here before, and I need a little time to overhaul my
mind.”</p>

<p>I could not help laughing, though I felt there was
something wrong somewhere. “Well,” I said, “what
made you come in if you were not prepared?”</p>

<p>Again he looked over his shoulder, and as he did
the truth began to dawn upon me. “Father,” he said,
“I was pushed in.”</p>

<p>“Kneel down,” I said, “and take all the time you
need, and when you are ready just call me. I am going
outside for a while.”</p>

<p>I went out and in a few minutes three figures came
noiselessly over to where I was standing. “Is he going
to go, Father?” one of them asked. “He is,” I
replied, “but he needs a little time to prepare. Why
did you send—I should say push—him in before he
was ready to go?”</p>

<p>They then told me that it was fifteen years since the
man had been to confession, and that he had been bragging
about not having been there for that length of
time. One of the number had told him three days before
to prepare and on account of this they had thought
him ready to go.</p>

<p>I think, on the whole, these lay apostles did excellent
work; still, now and then, there was an example of
perhaps too great zeal. Father Miles Tompkins relates
a story which perhaps showed a little overzeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
He was walking with Father McGillvary one day up
and down before a little church of a village where
troops were quartered when he noticed three khaki-clad
figures coming towards them. His first thought
was that some poor fellow had imbibed too freely of
“vin blink”—the soldiers’ name for the white wine—and
that two charitable comrades were escorting him
to his billet. When, however, the soldiers drew nearer,
he saw that the man was not intoxicated, though somewhat
indignant at being hustled so unceremoniously
by two comrades who did not bear the insignia of
military police. When they were within speaking distance
Father Tompkins asked one of the escort what
was the matter. “Father,” they said, as they looked
at their struggling victim, “this fellow wants to go to
confession.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Father Tompkins, “he does not look
very much as if he wanted to go!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Different Dispensers</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Thirteenth and Fifteenth Battalions were at Anzin,
a small village about three kilometers distant from
Ecurie Wood. There was a little brick church here
with a great hole through the base of its tower. I
used to go down there on my bicycle early Sunday
mornings and hear confessions while Father Pickett,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of the First Divisional Artillery, said Mass for my lads.
Then I would ride back to Ecurie Wood and say Mass
at half-past ten for the Fourteenth and Sixteenth.
There were now three other priests quartered at Ecurie
Wood and these would hear confessions during my
Mass. In the evenings the priests would assemble in
my hut—for, it seemed, I had the best billet in the
area—and talk over many things. It was not often
so many chaplains were together, and I, for one, enjoyed
these pleasant evenings in the little hut before
the blazing fire. It was a very dangerous area, however;
shells were dropping all over the camp and there
was great loss of life. One morning on awakening
from a very sound sleep a shell came shrieking through
the air, then the deafening explosion as it struck just
outside my hut. I waited, scarcely breathing, for the
next, but no more came. When I was dressed, I stepped
off the distance from my hut to where the shell
had struck. It was just thirteen steps. They were beginning
to come very near!</p>

<p>Those gatherings of chaplains in my corrugated iron
hut there on the Western Front were unique. I often
used to think of it in the evenings as we talked, or
when some chaplain read excerpts from a Canadian
paper that had come from home. It was this—that
while we talked away so casually about the ordinary
daily affairs of the world, in the pocket of every one
present dwelt humbly Our Eucharistic Lord in his
little home, the ciborium.</p>

<p>One afternoon while I was sitting in my hut, alternately
reading my book and looking into the fire, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
knock sounded on the door and a young officer walked
in, smiling broadly. He was a lieutenant in the artillery.
I had known him when he was a little boy
and I was in senior philosophy at college. I had not
seen him for ten years till I met him at the front. After
we had talked for a while, he asked me if he could go
to confession.</p>

<p>I put on my purple stole and sat down on the large
general service wagon seat, while he knelt down on
the earth floor—over which at times I saw worms
moving—and he began his little tale. Often, in our
old college days, when I was walking slowly on the
track of the athletic field he had come running up
quickly behind me, given me a punch on the back, and
then had skipped ahead of me, smiling pleasantly as
he waited for me to catch up to him. Now he knelt
humbly on the earth and confessed his sins, and I,
with all the powers of the priesthood, absolved him!</p>

<p>It was with great joy in my heart that I arranged
my little portable altar on a box, spread out the clean
white corporal and gave him Holy Communion.</p>

<p>After I had closed the altar and the young lieutenant
had finished his thanksgiving, we sat on the seat.
He was the first to speak. “Father,” he said, “these
are strange times we are living in.”</p>

<p>I agreed with him, and among other things thought
of the shell that had dropped just thirteen steps from
where we sat; but he was not thinking of shells.</p>

<p>“Three weeks ago,” he said, “I was in Rome on
leave, and on Easter Sunday all the Catholic officers
in the city had permission to assist at Mass in the Sistine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Chapel and receive Holy Communion from the
hand of Pope Benedict XV, amidst great splendor
and solemnity. Today, kneeling on the earth, I received
Our Lord in this little corrugated iron hut on
the Western Front!”</p>

<p>I did not speak for awhile; some strange emotion
held me silent as I visualized the two scenes. Easter
in Rome, in one of the most beautiful chapels in the
world, the Pope in the richest vestments, assisted by
many priests, giving Holy Communion. Then, a small,
dark hut, with not even a window in it, and no covering
over the clay floor, the priest in a wrinkled khaki
uniform and heavy trench boots, his only vestment a
small white stole worn over his tunic—yet, in each
case Jesus had come to the young officer!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Incapacitated</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The work at Ecurie Wood was most consoling, but
the shelling was incessant and we were having many
funerals in the military cemetery down the hill at
Roclincourt. The Fourteenth Battalion suffered most.
Early one morning a shell burst in the headquarters
hut, wounding the colonel, killing the second in command
and the adjutant, and disabling other officers
and privates. The whole camp was under observation
and Fritz was doing deadly work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>One Sunday morning, as I prepared for the Holy
Sacrifice, I seemed to feel much better than I had felt
for some time; and as I preached, the words came
quickly and without any great effort. I wondered
why I should feel so well. But after Mass, as I walked
back to my hut after having seen so many of those
wonderful lads receive Holy Communion, I raised my
hand to my forehead; it was very warm and the day
was cool—in fact, a fine mist of rain was falling. I
now began to feel slightly dizzy and more inclined to
rest on my camp bed than to drink my cup of tea.</p>

<p>George came in, looked at me once, placed the cup
of tea beside me on the seat, looked at me again, and
then told me I didn’t look very well. I told him I
did not feel very well. Both agreed that I would be
better in bed, so I went.</p>

<p>The corporal of the stretcher-bearers came in, shook
his little thermometer, looked at it, shook it again,
then told me to open my mouth. He placed it under
my tongue. Then, while I looked at the ceiling of the
hut, he waited.</p>

<p>“One hundred and two,” said the corporal.</p>

<p>“Is that high?” I asked, for I could not remember
ever having my temperature taken before.</p>

<p>“High enough,” he said. Then he told me I had a
malady that was becoming very prevalent in the army.
He did not know what to call it. Later, it was called
the “flu.”</p>

<p>I remained in bed for nearly a week, and it was one
of the finest weeks I spent in the army; so many officers
and men came into the little hut to see me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
was just beginning to understand the charity of the
army.</p>

<p>Just as I was getting about again the Fifty-first
Division of Scotch Highlanders came into our area.
This was the division that had met almost every advance
of the enemy, so that even the Germans themselves
could not but admire them. A sergeant in one
of the battalions of the division possessed a paper for
which he had refused six pounds: for the paper had
been dropped into their lines from a German airplane,
and this is what was written on it: “Good old Fifty-first
still sticking it! Cheerio!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Anzin and Monchy Breton</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Fifty-first “took over” from us and we went
to Anzin. Here it was much quieter and the battalion
prepared to rest. I took charge of the village church,
for I was the only chaplain in the area. The first day
I swept it out and dusted the altar and sanctuary rail.
The next morning I said Mass, and after Mass a little
sanctuary lamp twinkled softly before the altar. The
Guest had come!</p>

<p>There was a beautiful statue of Our Lady in the
church, and as it was her month I decorated it as well
as I could. A long walk by the Scarpe River, which
flowed its narrow though very pretty way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Anzin, brought me to the grounds of what had once
been a very fine country residence, now terribly battered
from shell-fire. The road that led to it sloped
up from the river, and as I walked along it, this beautiful
May day, from the dark recesses of the trees came
the repeated solitary call of the cuckoo. I stopped to
listen. The whole countryside seemed very quiet and
peaceful, save for the faint rumble, from far away, of
our guns.</p>

<p>Though the grounds were pitted in different places
with old shell-holes, many flowers grew in the garden.
I picked some white lilacs, although the season for
these was now growing late, and a large bunch of
Parma violets. It was very quiet and still there in
the old French garden, but I could hear German shells
whining through the air and dropping in a little village
not very far away.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line battles were being fought,
and I supposed the British were losing ground and
that many men were being taken prisoners. Up to
this time we Canadians had not lost any men as prisoners
and had given no ground except a mile in depth
near Neuville-Vitasse when we found ourselves placed
in a very dangerous position by the general retreat of
British troops, which in some places was more than
twenty miles in depth.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May good news came to us. We
were going back to rest. And it was to be a long rest,
among green fields, far from the sound of the guns
and the sights of the battlefield.</p>

<p>It was Saturday when we arrived in our rest billets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
after a long march through a peaceful countryside.
My battalions were scattered in four different villages
and I was very busy Saturday afternoon arranging
for Masses. Up to this time our rest billets had been
always in mining towns or districts, but now we had
come to one of the most beautiful countrysides I had
ever seen. Open, unfenced farmlands stretched before
us, while here and there clumps of ancient wide-spreading
trees, almost hiding from view the little white-walled,
red-roofed houses beneath them, rose as dark-green
islands in a light-green sea. The memory of
that Saturday afternoon is very vivid with me yet.
It had been a warm day and the long, dusty march
had been most fatiguing. I was finding some difficulty
in arranging hours for Masses, and towards three
o’clock I dismounted from my bicycle, sat by the roadside
and wiped my forehead. Everything was intensely
quiet; a Sabbath-day stillness was over all the
land. It seemed more like a beautiful dream than a
reality. For months I had been in the gruesome atmosphere
of war, gazing on broken villages, torn roads
and ruined farmlands, walking always in danger and
“in the shadow of death” through a country utterly
desolate, and foully marred by the ingenuity of men.
Now my eye was being filled with the beauty of all
things around me, of the wonderful things of God.</p>

<p>I picked a wild flower of a variety that grew in profusion
along the roadside. It was about one-third the
size of a morning-glory and somewhat similar in
shape. It was white, and so delicate that it seemed
almost transparent. As I gazed on its wonderful formation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
my mind dwelt on God and all the beautiful
things He had created; then my thoughts were of the
soul and then of my men. Presently the plan of my
sermon for the following day was mentally outlined.</p>

<p>It was twelve o’clock Saturday night when I finished
my work.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXVI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A New Sheep</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I awoke the next morning to the sweet sounds of
singing birds; to the glorious view of fresh green
fields and peaceful lanes. I rode about three miles
on my bicycle to a hamlet called Bailleul-aux-Cornailles
where I said Mass at nine o’clock for the Thirteenth
Battalion, which was quartered here, and a
great number of the French civilian population. The
curé of the parish was a soldier in the French army
and was on duty in a large military hospital at St.
Paul, about fifteen miles away. I made arrangements
to be at the parish church certain evenings in the week
for confessions. After this Mass I rode four miles further
to Ostreville, where I said Mass for the Fourteenth,
which was quartered here. The men were all
there when I arrived. I found them sitting in the
cemetery under century-old trees or along the low
stone fence. I preached the same sermon that I had
preached for the Thirteenth and it made a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
impression upon them. First I spoke to them briefly
of the awful scenes we had been witnessing for some
time; then I dwelt on the wonderful beauty and peace
all around us. God had made the whole world beautiful;
we had seen how foully men had marred it. But
God’s masterpiece of beauty was our own soul, and
each one of us knew just how much we had marred
that beauty. Then I told those lads that perhaps there
were some amongst us who had stained greatly their
immortal souls, who had done things for which certain
of their friends might despise them, might turn them
down. But God, in His infinite love, would not turn
them down. God was ready to receive them, to blot out
all their iniquities, to cleanse them, to make their souls
beautiful again. As I continued, I saw a wonderful
sight. I saw tears in the eyes of big, strong men, I
saw them bowing their heads as they reached for their
khaki handkerchiefs. It was one of the strangest and
sweetest experiences I had in the war.</p>

<p>After Mass, when I had got just beyond the village,
I dismounted, sat on the side of the road and began to
eat the luncheon I had brought—some sandwiches of
cheese and jam and a water-bottle full of cocoa. Rye
was growing all about me, and it was yet dark green
in color. After I had finished my luncheon, I stood
up to measure it, and found that it was almost as tall
as I. It must have been at least five feet in height.
Two or three weeks later I walked along a path through
a field of rye which was so high that I could see only
the stalks on either side of me and the heads just
above me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>On Monday I learned that we were out for a long
rest. Our program included drilling in the mornings
and games in the afternoon. From the nature of the
drilling it was clear to all of us that we were training
for an attack on Fritz. Part of the morning the men
followed the tanks that clanked their ungainly way
through beautiful fields of rye and wheat. We did
not know till August why they were so ruthlessly destroyed.</p>

<p>One evening while I was sitting in the very small
room which was my billet, a stout, red-faced soldier
in a rather soiled uniform came in to see me. He
saluted and I waited for him to state his business.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “I should like to become a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Going to be married?” I questioned.</p>

<p>An amused smile stole quietly over his face as he
replied: “No, Father. I am already married and have
five children.”</p>

<p>Then it was my turn to smile. I had judged him to
be about twenty-two or twenty-three, but now I noticed
that his hair was turning grey about the temples. I
asked him to sit down, which he did, after removing
his military cap. Then I saw that he was quite bald.</p>

<p>We commenced instructions, and as the days went
by I found him very quick to understand the different
things I explained. Now and then he would ask such
intelligent questions that I would start involuntarily.
At last I asked him what he did in civil life.</p>

<p>“I am a solicitor, Father,” he said quietly. I was
very much surprised. It had never occurred to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
that the soldier sitting before me in his greasy uniform
was a lawyer. On June 7th, in the little church of
Monchy Breton, I baptized him and received him into
the church.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Notre Dame d’Ardennes</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The soldiers greatly enjoyed the rest in this lovely
district. It was very pleasant to bicycle through the
country lanes to quaint churches where Catholic lads
waited in the evening to go to confession.</p>

<p>When I heard confessions for the Thirteenth at
Bailleul-aux-Cornailles, I often stopped in the presbytery
for tea. The mother and father of the curé lived
there. Perhaps I should not say tea, for it was always
milk and bread and honey that the kind old people
gave me. They had their own apiary in the beautiful
garden. The priest’s old father was very interesting
and I enjoyed greatly the stories he told me while he
sipped his wine and I drank my milk from the large
white cup. He had lived in Arras before the war and was
eager to hear what I had to tell him of my experiences
there. I recall how anxiously he inquired about the
church of Notre Dame d’Ardennes, whether it had
been struck. I did not know all the churches of Arras
by name, but I was very sorry to say that I thought
nearly every one had been struck by the Germans. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
could recall but one, which I had passed frequently
on my way to the railway station (Gare du Nord),
that had not been struck. I went on to describe it—a
large red-brick building.</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s it!” he cried. “It’s the Church
of Notre Dame d’Ardennes.” The old man’s eyes
brightened as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “if that is the Church of Notre
Dame d’Ardennes, you need not worry, for it is still
standing intact.”</p>

<p>The old lady, who sat near me, her hand near enough
to the jug of milk to replenish my cup almost as fast
as I made room in it for more milk, exchanged looks
with her husband, and although neither spoke for a
while, there was such significance in their glances
that I felt eager to hear the history of Notre Dame
d’Ardennes. I did not have to wait long, for presently
the old man began to speak. As I listened, I held
the palm of my hand spread wide over the top of my
cup, for there was still plenty of milk left, and the
kind old mother of the priest was beaming with hospitality;
but I felt I could not drink all the milk in the
jug!</p>

<p>During the fourth century—to be exact, in the
year 371—there had been a severe famine in Arras.
The people, being very pious, had recourse to prayer
and in answer to their supplications manna fell from
heaven. “The sacred Manna,” as it was called, was
gathered by the people and for a long time some of
it was kept and venerated by the people of Notre Dame
d’Ardennes. Then there was “the holy candle,” kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
in the Church of Notre Dame d’Ardennes. During a
severe epidemic in the year 1105 this wax candle had
been sent from heaven to Bishop Lambert. After it
had burned for some time, the plague stopped.</p>

<p>I had seen many strange things on the Western
Front, so that I wondered not that Notre Dame d’Ardennes
was unscathed.</p>

<p>During those beautiful June days from after Mass
till three o’clock, p. m., I had not much to do. I
usually read books or wrote a little, while I sat under
the tall trees in the open field behind the house where
I was billeted. One afternoon while I was reading
under the trees a young officer in the tartan of the
Sixteenth came up to see me. He was a fine looking
young fellow and had but lately returned to the battalion
after a long absence. He was very downhearted
and, although not a Catholic, had come to have a talk
with me. (Non-Catholics often came to have a talk
with me.) He was a captain and had come back expecting
to hold his old position in the battalion. But,
at times, promotion is rapid in the army and he found
that men who were his subordinates when he went
away were now of equal or superior rank. His position
was now held by one who had come through many
conflicts. There was no work for him to do. He felt
a stranger among these new officers. He was returning
to the officers’ reserve.</p>

<p>I listened quietly till he had told me all his troubles.
Sometimes it is a relief to have some one listen when
one’s heart is weighed down, but I am afraid I did
not say very much that could help him. Had I possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
the gift of foresight, I could have told this
anxious young officer that before three months the
officers’ ranks would be so thinned that orders would
come to him to report for duty immediately at the
front. But I did not know then that about the end of
September I was to meet him again, coming up a shell-swept
road in a terribly devastated countryside, with
the eager smile of a boy on his fine young face.</p>

<p>Just beyond where I was billeted stood a large
wooden structure that was being used by the Y. M.
C. A. as a moving-picture theatre. In the army the
name given to these places of amusement was “cinema.”
During the day the concert party of the Sixteenth
was practicing a play, entitled “A Little Bit of
Shamrock,” one of the chief characters of which was
a priest. George had spoken to me of the play, for
he had seen one or two practices. Now, I had seen a
play staged by this very cast some time before in
which was portrayed a minister, a most effeminate
character, whose chief mission, it seemed, was to display
a very great ignorance of life in general. The
amusement for the audience was furnished by him as
often as he was shocked or scandalized. The actor
who had taken the part of the minister was now to
take the part of the priest.</p>

<p>I went to the director of the company, who was an
officer from the Second Division, and told him quietly
that I had seen the play his company had put on before,
and that I had not admired his clergyman, though
I thought the actor had done excellent work. I hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the character of the priest in the forthcoming play
would not be like that.</p>

<p>The director looked at me, and I liked the bright
smile that spread over his pleasant face. “Don’t
worry, Padre,” he said. “I think you will like Father
O’Flynn. I have a lot of friends who are priests. I
like them. I always like to talk to priests of your
church, Padre. They are—they are—oh,—so <i>human</i>,
Padre.” And then he smiled a guileless smile,
so that I understood that by ‘human’ the young officer
had meant something complimentary.</p>

<p>Many days were to pass before I should see the play.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Procession</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Sunday within the octave of Corpus Christi was a
beautiful day. Just before I began Mass for the Thirteenth
at Bailleul-aux-Cornailles the father of M. le
Curé came in to see me. The usual great procession
of the Blessed Sacrament had been planned, but word
had come from the parish priest that he could not be
present for Mass, and that very likely he would not
be able to reach the church in time for the procession,
which was to start at half-past three in the afternoon.
If M. le Curé could not come, would M. l’Aumonier have
the goodness, if it would not inconvenience him too
much, to carry <i>le Bon Dieu</i> in the procession?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>I assured the good people that I would be only too
pleased to have the great honor of carrying the Blessed
Sacrament in their procession. They promised to send
a messenger to let me know whether or not the curé
would come for the procession, as they would have
definite word by twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>At one o’clock, while I was taking lunch, a messenger
arrived from Bailleul-aux-Cornailles saying that
M. le Curé could not come for the procession, and that
the whole parish respectfully requested me to carry
the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>When I reached the village for a second time that
day, I found all along the way evidences of great preparations.
On each side of the road approaching the
church, for a long distance, at intervals of about twenty
feet, saplings of different trees had been placed so that
they appeared to be growing there. Little girls, robed
in white, were flitting along the road, some carrying
banners, others holding decorated baskets of cut
flowers. From one side of the road a narrow lane,
arched darkly by old trees, led to a brightly decorated
altar under a large Calvary. Just opposite the orderly
room of the Thirteenth, where the road turned down
to the village church, a high green arch had been
erected, and on either side appeared in silver letters
the words, “Panis Angelicus.” Alongside the arch
was built another repository. While I was admiring
this, for there was yet much time, the adjutant of the
Thirteenth came down from the orderly room and
asked me the meaning of all the great preparations.</p>

<p>When I explained as briefly as possible what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
going to take place, he seemed surprised that I was
going to take part in the procession. He wondered
how it happened that I should know what to do among
these strange people.</p>

<p>The people were strange, but the religion was not.</p>

<p>At half-past three, sharp, the procession left the
church. It was led by a white-surpliced, red-cinctured
sanctuary boy, carrying the processional cross. Behind
him walked about a dozen confrères similarly
clad; then came the young boys of the parish, with
white ribbons on their arms. A lad perhaps eleven
years of age followed, clad in the skins of animals and
carrying a small cross on which were the words “Ecce
Agnus Dei.” The little girls, in snow-white dresses,
came next, and a few feet behind the column walked
a young girl of perhaps fifteen or sixteen, wearing a
long cream-colored dress with white, gold-bordered
wings coming out from her shoulders; a band of gold
encircled her head, to which was attached a gold star
which shone above her forehead; her right hand was
raised and the index finger pointed always towards
the sky. Then came four young girls in white carrying
on a pedestal the statue of Our Lady, and four
others, bearing on high the statue of the Sacred Heart.
The women of the parish, most of them wearing a
kind of light-blue badge, were next, followed by the
men of the parish, with here and there the blue uniform
of a French soldier home on leave. A few khaki-clad
lads also walked, but I think they were strangers.
(I wondered where my lads of the Thirteenth were.)
Then came the choir of middle-aged men singing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
hymns that today were being sung over all the world,
“Lauda Sion Salvatoris,” “Pange Lingua” and “Panis
Angelicus.” Behind these walked six little girls strewing
flowers in the way and two sanctuary boys swinging
censers. Lastly, came four old men, no caps on
their venerable heads, bearing on high the white and
gold canopy over Jesus Host in the great gold monstrance,
carried by a Canadian priest in the beautiful
Benediction vestments.</p>

<p>The vari-colored procession went slowly down the
village street, banners carried aloft and the beautiful
old Eucharistic hymns sounding on the summer air,
while very old people and others who for one reason
or another could not take part in the procession knelt
reverently in the dust on the roadside, as Jesus passed.</p>

<p>Then something happened that had never before happened
in that little village during a procession of the
Blessed Sacrament. Lining each side of the road for
quite a distance were men of the Thirteenth Battalion,
Catholic and Protestant, and as the procession moved
slowly along in all the sweet simplicity of the deep
faith of these French peasants, the soldiers stood reverently
to attention.</p>

<p>I felt proud of these lads. We had met together in
many strange places; but I am sure I shall never forget
those gay, light-hearted lads standing so quietly
and reverently as we passed—Jesus and I!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">On Leave</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had now been in France about one year and had
had no “leave.” During this period of the war officers
were entitled to leave every six months. I had not
applied when the first six months were up, as I was
too busy at the time. Now I had applied and daily I
was awaiting my warrant. The Sunday following the
procession I had just returned home after Mass when
a runner from headquarters arrived to tell me that
my warrant had come from brigade headquarters and
that if I would call at the battalion orderly room and
sign the necessary papers, I could procure it.</p>

<p>I left a little place called Tinques at five o’clock and
although the distance was only fifty miles, it was six
o’clock the following morning when we arrived at
Boulogne. The “Pullman” was of the side-door variety;
sometimes it held eight horses and at other times
forty men. It seemed to me, as we sat so closely packed
on the floor of the car, as if there were more than
forty of us. I sat the whole night long with my chin
almost resting on my knees. It would not do to stand,
for the space thus made would be quickly filled, so that
it would be almost impossible to sit down again. Although
many miles away from the sound of the guns
and cheered, furthermore, by the thought of fourteen
days’ leave, I have always felt that that night-ride was
one of the hardest of the war, for sitting in that
cramped position became actually painful. I longed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
stretch my limbs, but this was impossible. It was cold
in the car, for the doors were kept open so that we
could have air. It is almost incredible how that boxcar
bumped us about. But even through these hardships
we were compelled to laugh from time to time at
some witty joke or at some incident that was funny,
though not meant to be so. Once quite an altercation
arose between an officer and a private; the officer was
accusing the soldier of actually putting his feet in the
officer’s face. The soldier thus accused was protesting
in a very high-pitched voice: “They ain’t my feet!
They ain’t my feet!”</p>

<p>Everybody was laughing. Then came the gruff voice
of the officer, demanding: “Well, whose feet are they?”
But nobody seemed to know whose feet they were.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">St. Michael’s Club</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>St. Michael’s Club, 38 Grosvenor Gardens, London,
was an ideal hostel for priests, as it was open only to
men in Holy Orders. Before the war it had been the
city residence of Lady Lovat. But shortly after the
commencement of hostilities it had been rented from
her by the Duchess of Norfolk and very kindly given
over as a club for priests.</p>

<p>Though there were many chaplains in the building
when I arrived, I was lucky enough to secure an airy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
room. I actually felt like a boy as I took off my haversack
and flung it on the bed, after the hall porter had
left the room. It seemed so good to think that for
fourteen days the danger of being shot or blown up
by shell was very remote. Then there were many
friends and brother priests in the house, and outside
the door was London, and in London there were lots
of bookshops, and to a booklover this meant bliss. The
cathedral was but ten minutes’ walk from the club,
but we had our own little chapel in the building, and
the chaplains had the privilege of saying Mass there.</p>

<p>In the smoking-room, which was on the ground floor,
there were many large and deep-cushioned armchairs
that were very comfortable. There was a big open
fire-place and whenever the weather was damp or
gloomy outside in the London streets a bright fire
burned in it; one could count on there being a fire very
often. Sometimes in the evenings it would be very
quiet in the great wide room, as the priests sat around
reading the evening papers, the only sounds being the
occasional crackle of a newspaper, as it was turned,
and the purring of the fire. From outside could be
heard faintly the dull roar of the city, made up of a
medley of sounds: the rumbling of great elephantine
busses that bumped along the streets; the whir of
hundreds of taxis spinning along over the pavement,
the rattle of wagons and squeaking of innumerable
horns. Now and then the house would shake very
slightly, though perceptibly, as far below the basement
the cars of the underground railway whizzed
through the tubes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>I stayed at the club for four or five days and enjoyed
very much the time spent there. Bishop Fallon,
a Canadian prelate, whose diocese was London, Ontario,
was staying at the club. He had but recently
returned from a visit to the Canadian soldiers at the
front and was soon to go to Rome. I met there, also,
the chaplain-general to the New York state forces,
Monsignor James N. Connolly. He was a most lovable
man and I enjoyed talking to him in the evening. He
was vicar-general to the Catholic chaplain-bishop. He
gave me his address, Hotel Castiglione, Paris, and told
me to call on him if I ever visited that city.</p>

<p>Staying at the club were Irish, English, Scotch,
American, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian
priests. And of all the chaplains I found the Americans
the finest. They were lovable, friendly, broad-minded
men; one needed only to be in the room a few
seconds till he was on speaking terms with the American
priest. There was a certain friendliness about him
that was irresistible. “I’m Father Whalen, from Dubuque,
Father,” or, “I’m Father Joyce from naval
headquarters in London, Father,” or, “I’m Father
Waring from New York City, Father,” would greet
you on meeting for the first time one of these priests.
Whereas an English priest would look at you coldly,
and perhaps say in a chilly voice: “Good-evening,
Father.”</p>

<p>Father Knox came up from Bramshott and invited
me down. He said he had a surprise for me. I wondered
what it was. Shortly after seeing Father Knox
I received an invitation to spend a few days at Anthony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Place, Hindhead, Surrey, the country home of
Agnes and Egerton Castle, co-authors of many books.
Hindhead was only about three miles from Bramshott.
I had visited Anthony Place while there. I promised
Father Knox to visit Bramshott from Hindhead.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Parkminster Again</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Father Knox returned to Bramshott the following
morning and in the afternoon I left for Parkminster.
The life at the front had been one of such excitement
and turmoil and frequent changes that I longed for
quiet and peace. The very day I left for Parkminster
Bishop Fallon and party left by auto for Oxford University.
They had invited me to accompany them, but
I had already made arrangements to revisit Parkminster
and did not wish to change my program. I shall
always feel sorry, however, not only that I missed
seeing Oxford University, but also that I lost the opportunity
of meeting a number of priests whose names
were then famous in the literary world, among them
Fathers Martindale, Plater and Ricaby.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon when I walked up the
winding drive that led to the gates of the monastery.
This time I was greeted as an old friend. But the aged
monk who had been Retreat Master on my former visit
did not appear this time. He had been succeeded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
an alert young English priest who, I think, had but
lately come to the monastery. I missed greatly the
dear old priest with whom I had made my former retreat.</p>

<p>This time I did not settle down to the deep quiet
of the monastery. The year at the front had done its
work too well, and I now experienced the effects of
that tension which all who have taken part in the
World War know so well. A strange restlessness possessed
me, and I felt a distinct relief when my time
was up. But a little surprise was awaiting me.</p>

<p>I was told, when about to leave, that the prior wished
to see me, and so I waited in the parlor till he came.
He was a very tall man and I think had he followed the
routine of life that ordinary mortals follow he would
have been fat. But now he was slight. He was from
France, but had been at Parkminster a number of
years. He enquired about my work and I related some
of my military experiences. He took a great interest
in all I told him, and agreed with me that the war,
terrible as it was, was bringing many souls back to
God. When I told him of the procession of the Blessed
Sacrament at Bailleul-aux-Cornailles his eyes opened
wide and he looked at me strangely, so that for a
second or two I became just a little perturbed.</p>

<p>“Where,” he asked quickly, “did this procession
take place?” as if he felt he had not heard aright.</p>

<p>“At Bailleul-aux-Cornailles,” I repeated.</p>

<p>Then he sat back in his chair and the tense look
went out of his face and he regarded me smilingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
“Why,” he said, “that is my own parish. It was
there I was born!”</p>

<p>It was now my turn to be surprised, and I am afraid
I did not pay very much attention to his words as he
continued speaking. I just sat there quietly wondering
at the strange things that take place up and down
the ways of the world.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Another Surprise</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>From Parkminster I went to Hindhead and I was
delighted with the cordial reception given me by Mr.
and Mrs. and Miss Castle. Their home, almost hidden
from the road, looked down into a valley, and then
away across a moor that stretched up and over a long,
high hill.</p>

<p>I was not the only guest in the house. There was a
private chapel upstairs, and they had been given the
rare privilege of having the Blessed Sacrament reserved
in the little tabernacle. Here I said Mass each
morning for the household, and nearly all went to
Holy Communion.</p>

<p>The following morning I went up to Bramshott to
see Father Knox. He had now a beautiful chapel built
near the C. W. L. hut, under the patronage of St. Peter
and St. Paul; so now the Catholics were no longer
obliged to use the garrison church hut. After I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
talked with him for a while, he told me to go alone to
the hospital, which was just a few hundred feet away.
Somebody wished to see me in Ward 18, bed 20. “You
will see what you will see,” said Father Knox enigmatically,
as he followed me to the door.</p>

<p>This is what I saw after I had entered Ward 18
and had walked a few steps down the aisle. A young
fellow was sitting up in bed 20, his finger marking the
place in a little black book with red edges, his eyes
smiling a friendly greeting. But who was he? I approached
still nearer. Then I recognized him. It
was the Spanish lad who had come to Father Knox’s
room about one year and a half before to tell him that
he had lost the faith and was no longer a Catholic.</p>

<p>He seemed glad to see me and held my hand after
he had shaken it. I also was very pleased to see him,
for the strained look that I had noticed when I first
met him had gone from his eyes, and instead there was
a look of real joy there. The little book he held in his
hand was “The Imitation of Christ.”</p>

<p>“It is all right! It is all right!” he kept repeating,
as he smiled up into my face. “I have gone to communion.
I have made peace. I am very glad.”</p>

<p>I, too, was very glad. I had thought of him often
and had asked other priests to bring him back. And
here he was now, safe in his Father’s house! The
strayed sheep had come back into the fold. Not for
a long time had I felt so happy! I remember now, as
I returned to Anthony Place that day, while walking
along a secluded part of the way, twirling my cane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
around my fingers as the drum major does at the head
of a procession.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Back to the Battalion</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The men were never told on coming back from leave
where they might find their battalion; and when the
troops were on the move often a soldier was put to very
great inconvenience trying to reach his unit. I, however,
was in great good luck, for just at the base of
Mount St. Eloi, while the train stopped, I noticed some
of the soldiers of the Sixteenth standing near by. I
called one of them and asked the whereabouts of the
battalion.</p>

<p>“Just over here in Ecoivres, sir,” he said. I stepped
out of the train and in twenty minutes was sitting in
the transport mess talking of my leave.</p>

<p>I had found my friends in England somewhat downhearted,
which was but natural considering the great
losses the British army had sustained during the recent
German advances. On all sides one heard only gloomy
forebodings as to future attacks. But back again
among the gruesome scenes of devastation and ruin,
I was struck more than ever by the buoyancy and light-heartedness
of the troops. Here were no gloomy forebodings,
but on all sides were friendly faces and the
air was merry with sounds of whistling, singing, bugle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
calls, practicing bands, and good-natured banter. Of
one thing I felt sure—old “Major Gloom” did not belong
to the Third Canadian Brigade!</p>

<p>After I had talked awhile with the quartermaster
and transport officer, my mail was brought in. It was
very large, the accumulation of two weeks. It was a
long while before I had finished reading all the letters.
The transport officer had gone outside, but the quartermaster
was in the room adjoining the mess, from which
came now and then little explosions of partly suppressed
laughter. And whilst I read my letters I wondered
what was the cause of the mirth. In a little while
the quartermaster came out of the room and stopped
in passing to ask me if I had ever read “Seventeen”
by Booth Tarkington. Indeed, I had, and I wondered
no longer why sounds of laughter had drifted out to
me.</p>

<p>Among my letters were a few edged in black. One
of these, heavily crossed by a blue pencil, was registered,
and when I opened it a ten-dollar bill dropped
to the table. I had been accustomed to receiving many
letters edged in black, answers to those I had written
to next of kin at home, telling them of the death of
dear ones, and how they had been prepared to meet
God. It was not often, however, that they came registered.
But as I read the letter I forgot altogether that
a ten-dollar bill had dropped from it and was now lying
on the table.</p>

<p>The letter was from the wife of Captain Waud, the
young officer who had fallen at the head of his men—he
who had knelt so reverently with them to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Holy Communion that day in New Plymouth Cave. It
was not only a beautiful letter, with a deep note of
Catholic faith sounding throughout it, but it told me
something of the young officer that I had not known.
He had not always been a Catholic. I learned from the
letter that he had been wounded previously. “You
know, he did not have to go back to France,” wrote
Mrs. Waud, “but duty called, so I let him go with as
brave a heart as I could, and brought my little son
home. I had prayed so that my husband would be
spared to me, but indeed God knows best and He is
helping me now. Everything of that last day is comforting
and very beautiful. And although the heartache
and longing will not leave, I feel that I have a
great deal to be thankful for. I am enclosing a little
offering for whatever lies near your heart. It is little
and I wish it were more. I thank you for all you have
done for my husband, and indeed I will pray for your
lads. Trusting that you will remember me, and that
God will give me the grace to do my duty as worthily
as my husband did his, I am, gratefully yours, Ruth
Waud.”</p>

<p>For a long time I sat there thinking of the letter I
held in my hand, and then of other letters that had
come to me from time to time. And I thought how
many women there must be over the world bearing
great sorrows, but the eyes of the world were not focused
on these! They were on the battalions that had
marched away to the war while flags fluttered and
bands played and people cheered. They watched the
papers for accounts of great deeds of arms. But whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
I read such letters my thoughts would go back to
the roads over which the soldiers had marched so bravely
away, and I would see figures leaning over gates,
white handkerchiefs held to eyes that had strained
down the white dusty road over which their soldier
sons or husbands had marched away. They would go
back into silent rooms where so many little things
would remind them of their men. Then, as the days
would pass, to many would come words to chill the
heart and make homes desolate: “Killed in Action.”
Whenever I wrote to these poor mothers or wives, I
would see a great lonely hill, on which stood a cross
whereon was nailed a scourged, thorn-crowned Figure
whose eyes rested with great pity on one who stood below—the
Mater Dolorosa. It was on her feast, the
Feast of the Seven Dolors, that the bishop had decided
I should go to the war, and perhaps it was she who
helped me to write the letters of sympathy that brought
comfort to so many sorrowful hearts. With the ten-dollar
bill I bought comforts for the men.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">No Man’s Land Again</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I was billeted in a little hut with the billeting officer.
It was a very tiny hut, with two berths in it, one above
the other. As I was on leave when the battalion came
to Ecoivres, no provision had been made for me, so I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
was obliged to share the billeting officer’s hut which he
so kindly offered. He was a genial companion, but he
used to sit up very late at night puzzling over a chess-board.
He was playing a game of chess with a partner
who was actually residing in England, and every
night, after great puzzling over the board, he was
obliged to write the result of his efforts to his partner
in England. One evening—I suppose it was his partner’s
turn to play and it was for this reason that his
chess-board was idle—he took his Bible from his table
and said, naively: “Now, Padre, I won’t try to change
your views, and you won’t try to change mine, but
just take your Bible, and I will read certain passages
from mine, and you will read the same passages from
yours.”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling, as I reached for my Bible,
at the thought of the billeting officer not wishing to
change my views, for these words had just come to
my mind: “Upon this rock I will build My Church.”</p>

<p>I can’t recall the texts he picked out and asked me
to read from my Bible, but I remember that each one
seemed contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church
on the subject treated. As every one familiar with
the Douai-Rheims version of the Bible knows, there
are little notes on texts that might be disputed, giving
the true meaning and also reference to other texts
which would prove the teaching. Glancing at the footnote,
I would give the true interpretation and then refer
the amateur exegete to the other texts. In a little
while he closed his Bible. “Why, Padre,” he exclaimed,
“you know the whole Bible by heart!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Well,” I said modestly, as I suppressed a desire
to smile, “I don’t think I know it by heart, but you
know it is my business to teach the truths that are in
it,”—but I did not mention the foot-notes!</p>

<p>The following morning the billeting officer came
hurriedly into the room. “Padre,” he said, “we are
leaving here tomorrow night for the trenches. We’re
taking over the line in front of Monchy.”</p>

<p>For just a second or two a peculiar numbness
seemed to spread through every nerve in my body: it
was nothing new, however, for years before, when a
boy at the public school, after the teacher had opened
the drawer in her desk and removed a black, snakelike
piece of leather, and had said quietly: “Bennie
Murdoch, come up here,” this strange numbness had
come over me together with a slight contraction of
the muscles of the throat.</p>

<p>But it quickly passed, and after I had swallowed
once or twice to make sure of my throat, I said the
obvious thing: “Well, that means another move!”</p>

<p>Going into the trenches was not the only hard piece
of work I had to do. A very difficult task was before
me, though I did not know it till I went up to the mess
for lunch. Three or four letters were lying near my
plate. One envelope was much larger than the others
and bore in the upper left-hand corner the words
“Assembly Chamber, State of New York, Albany” and
beneath, was the address of Joseph V. McKee, 890 East
176th St., New York City, the brother of one of my
“Canadians” who was an American by birth, and had
lived all his life in the United States. There were many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
such, in the Third Brigade—Private McKee was in the
Fifteenth Battalion. I knew him well and he was one
of my very best Catholics.</p>

<p>I opened the letter and began to read it, and as I
did I felt that I was turning sick. The letter contained
a request that I please notify Private McKee that his
mother had departed this life.</p>

<p>After lunch I left on foot for Anzin, for I had learned
that the Fifteenth Battalion was quartered there. It
was a distance of only three miles, yet it was one of
the hardest journeys I ever made in France. Life
at the front was very hard for these lads, but it was
always brightened by the hope of finally seeing the
dear ones at home. It had not been very long before,
that Private McKee had spoken to me of his mother.
One of the loveliest things in this world is the love of
a good man for his mother. Every step was bringing
me nearer the lad, and I so dreaded the thought of
telling him! My head began to pain, and I went back
in memory to the first time I was called on to break
sorrowful news. I had been a priest just a little over
a year when one night the telephone bell rang, and a
trembling voice told me one of my men had been killed
by a falling log. There were fifteen men in the small
railway station where the voice was coming from;
they were only about two hundred yards from the
house where lived the widow of the man that was killed,
and I was six miles away. Yet not one would break
the terrible news. I was implored to come.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that night. A full moon was
throwing its light over all the white land, darkened here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
and there by a clump of green, white-patched trees,
but the thought of what I had to do had numbed me
to all sense of beauty. And as I drove along even the
horse seemed to feel what terrible work had to be done,
for once he actually stopped in the road and I had
difficulty in starting him; yet I could see no reason
for his having stopped.</p>

<p>As I walked along, dreading all the time what was
before me, I noticed that the soldiers who were quartered
along the road wore the purple patch of the Fifth
Division. They were artillerymen. Then a sign on
a door of a shell-torn house told me that an R. C.
chaplain dwelt within. I inferred that it was Father
McPherson, the Fifth Divisional Artillery chaplain,
one of the holiest priests in France; often I had seen
him kneeling down in a dugout or some poor billet reading
his Breviary.</p>

<p>I knocked on the door and was shown up to Father
McPherson’s room, and the sight of his pleasant kindly
face did me good. I told him of the task I had to perform.
He spoke sympathetically and invited me to
call in on my return and have tea with him.</p>

<p>After leaving Father McPherson, the thought of what
I had to do did not weigh so heavily. Perhaps it was
that the prayers of the good priest I had just left
followed me.</p>

<p>They told me at the Fifteenth Battalion orderly room
that Private McKee was quarantined,—the “flu” was
now becoming quite prevalent among the men. I found
him sitting in a bell tent, one of a group pitched in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
large garden of a chateau. I called him, and when he
came we walked up and down a long garden path under
the trees while I broke as gently as I could the terrible
news I had for him.</p>

<p>He took it well—took it bravely and quietly like the
good soldier he was, with great submission to the holy
will of God, like the good Catholic his dear mother had
brought him up to be. I talked with him a little while,
and when I left I asked Our Lady of the Seven Dolors
to stay with the lad and to comfort him.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">No Man’s Land</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following day we took over the line just before
Monchy. The quartermaster, transport officer and I
had a nice little mess at Berneville, near Arras. I was
billeted with the curé of Berneville and he proved a
friendly old man. His old sister was housekeeper for
him. She was very kind, and George received many
cups of hot coffee.</p>

<p>It did not happen very often that battalion headquarters
were in the front line trench; yet it so happened
when we were at Monchy. Indeed, the first
night, on going up to the trenches, I actually walked
through No Man’s Land in order to reach headquarters’
dugout. It was a part of the line that we had retaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
from the Germans, and for this reason the opening of
the shaft leading down to the dugout faced the German
front instead of our own back area.</p>

<p>The second night I spent in the line at Monchy I
was awakened suddenly by a terrific bombardment by
the Germans. The dugout was shaking from the concussion
of the shells bursting on the ground above us.
I had been sleeping fully dressed and with my trench
coat on; for although it was July it was very cold
underground. My bed was a berth of meshed wire
stretched between rough scantling—nothing else, not
even a blanket; my pillow was my haversack. When
I awoke I was trembling violently, I was not sure
whether through cold or fear. Yet after I stood up and
walked up and down a little while talking to the officers,
I ceased to tremble.</p>

<p>The Germans were putting on a box barrage, that is,
they were bombarding us in such a way that the shells
were dropping behind us, and to our left and right, so
that we could not retreat and no troops could come
to our aid. The only way open to approach us was
from the German trenches opposite, by way of No
Man’s Land. This was the way the Germans would
be coming presently, either to order us up or to throw
bombs or tubes of amenol down to blow us into minutest
fragments. We talked quietly as we waited there
at bay; but we were all a little nervous. I shall never
forget those minutes we spent there, caught like rats
in a trap.</p>

<p>We waited and waited; the very atmosphere of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
dugout seemed heavy and sickening. Then suddenly
the bombarding ceased. Surely, Fritz had not changed
his mind; yet it was always under cover of his own
artillery fire that he made his advances or raids. We
became a little cheerful. Finally, after half an hour
of quiet we concluded that for some unknown reason
Fritz had decided not to come. Then, our hearts filled
with relief, we sat about the candle-lit dugout chatting
like happy boys on their way home for vacation.</p>

<p>The following morning, with God’s beautiful sunlight
over all the land, I stepped out into No Man’s
Land with Colonel Peck and we took a little walk.
Beautiful red flowers resembling in size and shape the
sweet pea, only they were short-stemmed and in clusters,
grew near an old pile of stones. It was the first
time I had ever seen flowers growing in “No Man’s
Land,” and I began to pick a few. The colonel, however,
told me to hurry. Indeed, it was no place to
loiter, for although No Man’s Land was very wide here,
one could see the parapets of the German trenches.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXVI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Cambligneul</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Here we came for a week’s rest after our turn in
the line. We little knew then what strenuous days
were before us, nor what terrible toll was to be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
of our ranks before we would rest again. It was a
very pretty countryside, though not so open as the
area we had occupied in June.</p>

<p>It was now the end of July, and although my troops
were scattered over very wide areas I managed to do
good work with the Thirteenth and Fourteenth. Indeed,
one evening I found one hundred and twenty-five
lads of the Fourteenth waiting for me in a quaint little
church at a place called Chelers, or Villers-Chatel. This
was indeed extraordinary for an evening during the
week, when there was no hint of our soon leaving for
the front line. The Fifteenth and Sixteenth had not
been having a very good chance of late to go to confession.
Whenever the four battalions were separated,
I always gave the Thirteenth and Fourteenth the preference
for Masses, as there were more Catholics in
either one of these than in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth
together. These two latter battalions were often
obliged to attend the village Mass said by the curé of
the parish in which they happened to be.</p>

<p>August came, and the rich promise that was over
all the land in June was now being fulfilled: great
brown stacks of hay, like dark hillocks, stood over all
the green land, and here and there were large golden
patches of rye, weighed and bent low with the full kernels,
so that now they were not much higher than my
waist. In fields and gardens were low bivouacs, about
three feet in height, where soldiers slept at night.</p>

<p>Cambligneul was a very small village and had no
resident priest but was served from Camblain L’Abbey,
which was only about a mile and a half distant. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
was billeted in a farmhouse not far from the church.
The old lady of the house resembled very much the
wife of the captain in the “Katzenjammer Kids.”</p>

<p>One rainy afternoon the old lady made bread, and
as I had never seen bread made in France, I was very
interested in the process. It was a different one than
that employed in country houses at home. The old
lady mixed the dough in a large trough-like affair that
resembled a half-barrel that had been cut horizontally
on a wood-horse. Into this was poured a great quantity
of flour and water which the capable arms of
“mamma Katzenjammer” worked quickly into dough.
When it was kneaded sufficiently, an iron door was
opened in a large brick oven, and from it a few embers
were quickly drawn. This part of the process
surprised me very much as I did not know that a wood
fire had actually been made in the oven. Then the old
lady took a long-handled flat wooden shovel that stood
near the kneaded dough, which had not been set to
rise, but had been placed on paper in flat wicker baskets.
She picked up each basket and upset the dough
on the shovel; each basket contained just enough dough
to cover the shovel and still be about two inches in
thickness. The shovel was pushed far into the oven
and then with a quick jerk by the experienced hands
of old Madame, was drawn out empty. When all the
dough in the baskets had been put in the oven the
door was closed and, if I remember rightly, it was two
hours before the oven was opened again. It was George
who came to tell me that Madame was going to open
the oven. I went out just in time to see the old lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
pull to the front of the oven, by means of a long-handled
hook, the great flat loaves of dark-brown bread:
there were fifteen loaves in all, about one foot and a
half in diameter and two inches deep. It was very
good bread, as I discovered when I tasted some the
following day.</p>

<p>Before the following Sunday orders came to march.
First we went to Berneville, and on Saturday, after I
had arranged for church service for Sunday, we were
moved to Lattre-St. Quentin. The other battalions
were quartered in the same area. It was late Saturday
night when I finished organizing for Sunday; but the
services were not to be. More marching orders came.
We were to leave in the morning at five o’clock for
Avesnes-le-Compte, where we were to entrain, destination
not given. The hour had struck; big things
were before us.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A New Front</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was half-past three Sunday morning when I awoke.
I dressed quickly, went down to the little church and
said Mass. When I left the church the road was filled
with soldiers moving in different directions, carrying
mess tins of steaming porridge, across the top of which
was placed some bread and butter with a strip of fried
bacon; in the other hand was the cover of the mess tin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
filled with hot tea. They were all joking and in excellent
spirits; yet before the following Sunday—</p>

<p>We entrained between eight and nine o’clock and
all day long there was great speculation as to our destination.
Some thought that the division was returning
to the Ypres salient; others guessed that we were
on our way up to the North Sea coast. Later in the
day it was rumored that we were going to Etaples,
where there was to be more drilling. For awhile it
seemed that we were returning to the area about
Etaples. But towards evening we knew the truth; we
were coming into the area on the Somme.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when we detrained, and
to this day I do not know the name of the place. We
took supper and then began to march. We crossed the
Somme River and then in the darkness went through
what seemed to be a very pretty country, one more
wooded than I had yet seen in France. And as we
went on and on under ancient wide-spreading trees, I
began to wish it had been daylight, for surely it must
have been some famous forest of France.</p>

<p>There had either been some confusion of orders or
else our guides did not know the way, for we spent
the whole night marching over dark roads, through
quiet villages and dense forests. One little scene stands
out in my memory quite vividly. We had been marching
for a long time when the order came ringing
through the darkness: “Fall out!” The men fell out
and immediately began to sit around on the damp
earth; a fine mist of rain had been falling for some time.
Permission was given to smoke, and presently hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
of tiny red circles glowed in the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>“Where are we now?” some one asked. Of course
he was bombarded with replies, but none of them
proved correct; indeed, many went very wide of the
mark as they meant to do, for they were names of
Canadian towns or countries.</p>

<p>Presently I noticed the white circle of light from a
flash-lamp move over a field map spread out on the
ground, and in the relative silence that had now ensued
I listened intently, as the low murmur of the
voices of the officers regarding the map came to my
ears. They mentioned the name of some place but
I did not catch it; then one officer spoke louder, so
that I heard quite distinctly: “It’s Picardy we are
now in, Picardy.”</p>

<p>He stopped speaking, and from the opposite side of
the glade came the sound of a murmured conversation.
It ceased, and in the silence a wonderful clear voice began
to sing softly, yet not so low but that all could
hear, the song “Roses are Blooming in Picardy.” I
had never heard the song before. It seemed fitting
for that young soldier to be singing there in the damp
forest while his companions listened and joined in the
chorus. I suppose for many of those brave young lads
who sang the words had a special significance.</p>

<p>We kept marching slowly, and resting; five o’clock
showed on our wrist watches. Then we came to our
halting-place.</p>

<p>It was a strange little village to which we came.
Perhaps I should not say that it was “strange,” for
it was built like all other farming villages of France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
but the people were strange: they had never seen
Canadian soldiers before, and only rarely since the beginning
of the war had they seen the soldiers of their
own country. All the people turned out to see us
as if a circus had come to town. The soldiers were
treated with very much more consideration than they
had been accustomed to, and the prices in the village
stores were extremely low.</p>

<p>I slept a few hours and then took my bicycle and
went out to try to find the Fifteenth Battalion. I
could get no information from the orderly room.
Everything was being done with the utmost secrecy;
we might move at any time. But George, ever-faithful
George, told me he had seen the Fifteenth transport
officer going to a little village said to be only three
miles distant. I started, but found progress very difficult
once I had left the village. The gentle mist of
rain that had been falling through the night had increased
towards morning and caused the wet, oily clay
to adhere to the tires of my bicycle; sometimes the
wheels skidded, and sometimes I was obliged to dismount
and remove the clay that clung so tenaciously
to the fork above the front wheel. Once I saw a number
of the Thirteenth going towards a village on my
right. After I had passed them I became worried. I
was not sure of finding the Fifteenth but I felt that
I could reach the billets of the Thirteenth by following
the lads I had just seen. I continued a little farther
on my way, still thinking of the Thirteenth. I
dismounted, turned, and began to ride in the direction
the Thirteenth soldiers had gone. I had not gone far,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
however, when I began to think that after all the Fifteenth
had much greater need of my services than the
Thirteenth; for all I knew then, we might be in the
line that very night. I stopped again in the road and
stood by my bicycle. Never in my life had I felt such
indecision, but it was serious work I had to do—perhaps
by tomorrow many of the lads would be killed.
And here was I standing in the road almost in a
panic—doing nothing!</p>

<p>I now began to pray to the Little Flower. I had
never prayed to her before; the Blessed Virgin had
always looked after all my wants. I remounted and
presently I was going down a long hill very swiftly,
finding great difficulty in managing my wheel. Just
when I was half-way down I met a runner of the Sixteenth.
He had passed me before I could stop, so I
turned my head a little to call to him. The next thing
I knew I had shot completely over my machine and
was on my hands and knees on the road, a severe pain
in one of my knees. The runner turned quickly, a
look of concern in his eyes; but I had twisted my face
into a smile and his face brightened.</p>

<p>He pointed out a clump of trees on the opposite hill
and told me I would find the Fifteenth there. I did,
and gave some of them Communion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXVIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Boves</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I returned to the Sixteenth and succeeded in giving
Holy Communion to a few soldiers, among whom was
the solicitor whom I had baptized at Monchy Breton.
But I was by no means pleased with my day’s work,
for I had not gotten all the Catholics in each battalion.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we left this area, and towards morning,
after marching continuously, were met by a long
line of busses that brought us through the city of
Amiens to within three or four miles of Boves. We
marched for nearly two hours and about ten o’clock
came into the city of Boves, from which all the inhabitants
had gone.</p>

<p>I was very tired and hungry, but I had not broken
my fast, for I wished to say Mass, if I could find time,
in order that I might offer it for the success of my
work among the soldiers.</p>

<p>I easily found the church of Boves, and just as I
entered, met a chaplain of the French army coming
out. I saluted and told him who I was. He was a
friendly priest and had one of the kindest faces I have
ever seen. We talked for a little while, then, as there
was no parish priest at Boves, he came back to the
sacristy to show me where to find things. Then he
served my Mass.</p>

<p>I had lunch in the mess of the French chaplain, after
which I went out into the highways and byways seeking
my men. I had excellent news. The whole Third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Brigade was billeted in the city. This was the first
time since March 28th that I could remember having
all my units together. Not content with announcing
confessions at the orderly rooms of the different battalions,
fearing there might be some miscarriage of
orders and that some of the men might not be notified,
I went all over the city visiting them. It had not
been very long since the majority had gone to confession,
yet I wished to give every one an opportunity.
I had learned at brigade headquarters that the battalions
would not go into the trenches till ten o’clock
that night.</p>

<p>At five o’clock, when I entered the church of Boves,
I was somewhat nervous. At Mass that morning I had
forgotten to look in the ciborium to see how many consecrated
Hosts there were. I went straight to the
altar, opened the tabernacle door, took out the ciborium
and opened it. As I feared, there would not be
enough Particles for one-tenth the number I expected!
I closed the door softly, saying a little prayer as I
did so, and walked back to the confessional in the
rear of the church, for the men were beginning to
arrive.</p>

<p>I had not reached the confessional when I noticed
the French chaplain coming into the church. I went
to him quietly and made known to him what I had
learned from my visit to the tabernacle. He was sympathetic
and immediately began to think what we
could do. First, he thought of saying Mass, although
it was then five o’clock in the afternoon and he had
broken his fast; it seemed, however, to each of us that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
he would be quite justified in so doing. Then suddenly
he remembered a convent chapel, about seven kilometers
distant, where he felt sure there would be a
ciborium with a sufficient number of consecrated Hosts.
He said he would go on horse-back. Seldom have I
felt more grateful than I did to him that night.</p>

<p>I began to hear confessions and the lads came in
great numbers. Soon the light became dim in the
great church and lads who had come first began to be
a little restless: they wondered why I did not give
them Holy Communion.</p>

<p>It was now becoming so dark that I could just distinguish
the crowds of kneeling soldiers. I was hearing
confessions very quickly. Once a fellow knocked
on the confessional door and told me he hoped I would
soon give communion, as he had some things to do
before going into the line. He had now been waiting
a long time, he said. I asked him if he could wait a
few minutes longer, as time was so precious and such
crowds of men were coming that I did not wish to
leave my confessional for a minute. I was praying between
the drawing of slides for the appearance of the
French chaplain. No soldier had yet left the church,
yet I feared they might. Then away up in the sanctuary
I noticed a little flame flash out in the darkness
and then move quickly to one side of the tabernacle,
where it touched the responsive wick of a candle and
another gleam of light shot up, then, on the other side
of the tabernacle, the other candle flashed. As I heard
the slow moving of many feet towards the altar-rail,
I thanked God.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>For a long while the priest, after placing two lighted
candles on the sanctuary railing, moved up and down
between them dispensing the Bread of the Strong to
those Canadian soldiers. When all who were ready had
received, he put the ciborium in the tabernacle and
knelt to pray till I had prepared more lads for him.</p>

<p>I did not move from my confessional till after ten
o’clock, and it was after this hour before I left, for
still men came. They were now coming fully equipped
for battle, hoping to catch up with their companions,
who must have already left.</p>

<p>When the last man had been shriven, the chaplain
came down to have a little talk with me. I was almost
overcome as I thanked him for what he had done, for
I was now beginning to be very tired.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with a beaming face, “are you
happy? Are you happy?”</p>

<p>“Happy?” I repeated. “Indeed, I am, for wonderful
things have been done tonight for God!”</p>

<p>As I walked down to my billet that night I was
swaying, as I went, from sheer exhaustion; I tried to
recall when it was that I had a night’s sleep. It seemed
months, yet it was but a few days. My billet was upstairs
in a house that had not been struck by enemy fire.</p>

<p>George met me at the door and told me to go to my
room, that he would bring my dinner. I stumbled upstairs,
for I was weak with hunger and fatigue. I
sat in a chair and was almost falling asleep when
George came in with a large granite plate filled with
roast beef, mashed potatoes and green peas. He had
kept it hot for me. I picked up the knife and fork and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
they seemed heavy. George began to arrange my bed.
New strength came as I ate the excellent food—we
were always well fed before a battle; in fact, the men
could always foretell a battle by the quantities of
strawberry jam they received two or three days preceding
action. I had not finished the meat and vegetables
when the cook himself came up with some strawberry
jam, little cakes and a huge granite mug of hot
cocoa. When I had finished the cocoa, I can just remember
George saying: “Hadn’t you better take off
your boots, sir?” And the next thing I knew it was
broad daylight, and as I looked at my wrist-watch the
hands pointed to half-past ten a. m. I had slept about
ten and one-half hours.</p>

<p>I had learned the preceding night that the battle
would not begin till very early in the morning of August
8th. It had taken, I supposed, the whole night
for the troops to assemble. Very likely they would
sleep or rest today. There was no need for me to go
up till evening.</p>

<p>I looked about the room. The dinner dishes had been
removed and so had my boots, but with the exception
of boots and leggings I was completely dressed. It
did not take me very long to put on my boots and shave,
yet it was twelve o’clock when I came out of the church
of Boves after I had said Mass.</p>

<p>That evening, August 7th, I went up to Gentelles
Wood.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Battle of Amiens</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a wonderful sight that met the eye as George
and I left Boves that evening and turned our steps
towards the battle-ground. The artillery had assembled,
and on all sides were great guns in cuttings
of embankments or hidden in woods, or camouflaged
in the open. At times the roads were blocked with
the heavy lines of traffic, but as we drew nearer the
line the movement was not so great; yet coming through
fields and woods were the huge, clanking tanks. There
must have been at least one hundred of them careening
along up hill and down dale. Nothing seemed to be
able to stop their unwieldly bulk. I learned afterwards
that great bombing planes had swooped low
over Fritz’s trenches, making a great noise so as to
deaden the sounds of the assembling tanks.</p>

<p>I did not sleep at all that night. Indeed, very few
slept, for during the night the troops were taking their
place for the assault and it was not till 2:10 a. m. that
the assembly was complete.</p>

<p>At 4:10 a. m., August 8th, a terrific crash of heavy
and light guns broke the silence of the dawn on a
twenty-mile front. I had never before been in a great
battle and was not prepared for action on such a stupendous
scale. The earth seemed to be rocking. The
full-leaved tree-tops of Gentelles Wood behind us
twisted and broke, as shells from our back areas
shrieked their way towards Fritz’s line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>I stood for awhile waiting for Fritz’s “come back,”
but the Germans had been so completely surprised by
the unexpected bombardment that their artillery gave
but a very faint-hearted reply. On seeing this we felt
that victory was assured. I did not have long to watch
the tide of battle, for presently a long line of stretcher-bearers,
their burdens raised shoulder high, told me
my work was to begin.</p>

<p>All day long I walked up and down among the
wounded, hearing confessions, giving Holy Communion,
anointing those mortally wounded, and taking messages
for dear ones at home. Among the dying were
many Germans, and a number of these were Catholics.
I knew only one sentence in German: “Sind sie Katholisch?”
“Are you a Catholic?” but it was sufficient,
for I understood when the reply was “Yes,” or “No.”
When a German would say he was a Catholic, I would
put on my stole, open my little ciborium, hold up the
Sacred Host, and then I would look at him. Always
his two hands would fold, and I would wait kneeling
by his side till he had finished his act of contrition;
then I would give him Holy Communion. It was a
beautiful sight to see the tears of gratitude come into
the eyes of those dying Germans after they had received
their Lord; and after I had anointed them, invariably
they reached out and gripped my hand before
passing out. Many lads were ushered up to the gates
of heaven that day.</p>

<p>The following morning George and I went up to
Caix. My own brigade was now out of the fight for a
while, but I was following with the Second Field Ambulance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
For a long time we waited on the side of
the road, as the place we intended to hold for an advanced
dressing station had not yet been taken. About
1:10 p. m. I stood on a hill and watched the men of the
First Brigade come up into action. An Irish chaplain
whom I had once met at St. Michael’s Club was riding
behind them. He told me that he had just given them
a general absolution.</p>

<p>All that afternoon, and late into the evening, I
worked with the Second Field Ambulance. A great
number of wounded passed through. Once some enemy
airplanes swooped low and dropped bombs amongst
us, but they failed to kill any one. We were now in
open warfare, and for the first time I saw the cavalry
in action. They came cantering across an open field,
their spears, held at their sides, pointing heavenwards,
ribbons fluttered from the long handles, and the burnished
points flashed in the sunlight.</p>

<p>That evening I was relieved by Father Locharay and
I found a small dugout where I got a few hours of
sleep.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">At the Wayside</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning George and I left to find the
Sixteenth which had passed through in the evening.
We anticipated some trouble, for to find one’s battalion
after an attack is not the easiest thing in the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
However, we saw the Sixteenth Battalion water cart
in the great procession that filled the road before us,
so, keeping our eyes on it, we slipped in behind a
transport wagon and followed along on the right side
of the road. We went slowly, and at times halted for
five and sometimes ten minutes. Now and again some
of the horses in the procession, as we passed dead
horses on the side of the road, would begin side-stepping
in their fear, and this would interfere somewhat
with the progress of the line.</p>

<p>We had been walking with many halts for over an
hour, and I remember how surprised I was that our
soldiers had advanced so far. All the marks of the
advance were along the way: broken war-wagons of
every description, dead Germans and dead Canadians,
deep shell-holes, shattered buildings, and always in
the air mingled with the dust that rose from the busy
road were the odors of gas and sulphur.</p>

<p>We had been walking on the right of the procession,
and to this day I cannot say why I decided to change
my place. For no reason that I can remember I
stepped in front of a team of mules hitched to a general
service wagon and crossed to the left of the
road. Then I noticed two soldiers approaching carrying
a wounded comrade on a stretcher. I am certain
that if I had not crossed to the left of the road I
would not have noticed them.</p>

<p>Just as the lads came alongside me they halted and
I heard one say: “He ain’t dead yet.” Then gently
they lowered their burden to the road in order to
take a short rest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>I stepped over to the wounded lad and a glance
told me that he had not much longer to live. I knelt
quickly on one knee and pulled out the little round
identification disc attached to the string around his
neck. I looked at it and saw the letters “R. C.”</p>

<p>I remember throwing off my shrapnel helmet (“tin
lid,” the lads called it) and it rattled on the hard
road, though the noise was deadened by the rumble
of the passing traffic. Then I spoke to the lad, telling
him I was a Catholic priest. Finding him conscious,
I told him to make a good act of contrition for all the
sins of his past life and that I would give him absolution.
Then, as the great procession went lumbering
by I pronounced the words of absolution, and anointed
him there on the roadside. In a little while he passed
away peacefully.</p>

<p>I copied from the little leather disc his name, number
and battalion: Private W. J. Daze, No. 788567,
Third Canadian Infantry Battalion. A few days later
I got his mother’s address from the Third Battalion
orderly room and wrote her, telling how grace had
come to the lad.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">In An Apple Orchard</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>We remained on the Amiens front nearly three
weeks, and we were lucky enough not to have much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
rain, for we were in trenches where there were no
dugouts.</p>

<p>The transport mess was in an apple orchard, one of
the great old orchards of Picardy where in days before
the war, happy peasants picked the apples to
make the golden cider.</p>

<p>There were many troops quartered in this orchard,
as the trees offered shade and screened us fairly well
from the ever baleful eye of enemy airplanes. Yet almost
every evening we were bombed. We would hear
the signal of his approach long before the whir of his
motor became audible. We would be sitting in groups,
sometimes around little fires of wood or charcoal, talking
in low voices, when suddenly there would come
three shrill blows of a whistle, the kind used by referees
of football matches. Instantly water would be
poured on fires, or a few shovelfuls of earth would be
thrown over the bright embers, and then a hurrying
and scurrying to trenches; the sounds of laughter and
pleasant talk would die away with the hissing of the
expiring fires. Then profound silence, save for the
champing of horses tethered at one end of the orchard
under the trees. Presently from far up in the sky,
coming nearer and nearer, would sound that peculiar
err-rum, err-rum, err-rum, which left no uncertainty in
our minds as to whose airplanes were approaching.</p>

<p>Sometimes they would go far beyond us and we
would hear the terrific crash and explosion as their
bombs dropped in our back areas; sometimes they
would drop near our own lines and we would lie there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
waiting.</p>

<p>From a certain point in the orchard we had a very
good view of many of our observation balloons, far
in our rear. I remember one day, while a group of
us were sitting talking, suddenly hearing from high
in the air near one of our balloons the quick rat-tat-tat
of machine-gun fire. Immediately all eyes were raised
in time to see a German airplane swoop down from a
bank of clouds perilously near our observation balloon.
The enemy was firing from his machine-gun, for every
three or four seconds we could see the flash of phosphorous
as the tracer bullet sped through the sky. If
one of those touched the great silk bag of gas—it did,
and almost simultaneously there was a burst of dark-red
flame, fringed with black, waving out from the
balloon. There was a cry of consternation from many
voices in the orchard as two figures were seen to jump
from the aerial car of the balloon. We held our
breath. Then with a spring, one after the other, the
white parachutes opened, and we breathed a sigh of
great relief as they came gracefully to the earth.</p>

<p>Our observation balloons must have been doing excellent
work, for after this Fritz was very busy bringing
them down. One afternoon the same airplane actually
brought down, one after the other, five balloons.
Then, as it started on its return flight, it seemed to be
flying very low. Immediately every machine-gun in
the area began firing on him. There must have been
thousands of bullets soaring towards the speeding
’plane; but it is very difficult to judge, from the
ground, distances in the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly the machine stopped in its course and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
came spiralling slowly downwards. A great cheer
burst from hundreds of throats and simultaneously
the machine-guns ceased to fire. There was complete
silence in the camp as we watched the falling airplane.
But we had reckoned without our host; for suddenly
it ceased to fall, then like a lark shot gracefully up,
up, till it reached a safe distance. Then with admirable
audacity it looped the loop, and finally winged its way
towards home.</p>

<p>What did we do, gentle reader? For a few seconds,
overcome with amazement, we stood there gazing skywards,
then from all over the area there were sounds
of clapping hands as we good-humoredly applauded
“Old Fritz.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXXII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Strange Interruption</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Every morning I said Mass in the part of the trench
where I slept, which was covered overhead with a
piece of camouflaged burlap, spread across pieces of
scantling. The trench was so low that I was obliged
to dig a hole in the ground, so that I could stand upright
at my little portable altar. One morning while
I was saying Mass, a little fox-terrier, belonging to
George and the transport cook, began walking on the
burlap above my head. As the burlap was taut, the
small paws made a kind of drumming sound above me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Both George and the cook, although they were non-Catholics,
wished to show every respect to the chaplain;
knowing I was saying Mass, they began to call
off the dog. The little fellow, however, was stubborn
and wished to remain on the burlap. I think that the
cook and George then got sticks and tried to poke him
off, for I could hear him dancing up and down as the
points of the sticks tapped the burlap roof. It was a
long time before he was captured, and it was at the
cost of so much extra noise that I think it would have
been better had they left him to follow his own inclinations—but
the lads’ intentions were good.</p>

<p>New drafts now began coming to the battalions to
reinforce the ranks, broken in the Battle of Amiens.
One afternoon the adjutant told me that a draft of
seventy men had come and that they were going into
the front line that night. The senior chaplain of the
division, Canon Scott, an Anglican clergyman, was going
to address them first, after which, he said, if I
wished I might say a few words to them.</p>

<p>I went to the orderly room, where I learned that
thirteen out of the seventy soldiers were Catholics. I
waited a long time that evening for the Canon to
finish. When, at last, he had ceased speaking and had
invited those who wished to attend the communion service
to step over to the side of the lines, I spoke to
the men. My talk did not take very long. I first
asked the Catholics to fall out. Immediately, from
different sections in the ranks, thirteen men stepped
out before me. I told them that as they were going
into the front line and did not know what might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
before them, perhaps they would wish to go to Holy
Communion. I told all who wished to do so, to follow
me down into the trench where I would hear their confessions
and give them Holy Communion. I turned
and proceeded towards the trench. Thirteen men followed
me.</p>

<p>That night, after I had wrapped myself in the blankets
of my bed-roll, a lieutenant, a middle-aged man who
was sharing part of the trench with me, came down to
retire for the evening. As he lay smoking a last pipe
before drawing the curtains of sleep, I was surprised
to hear him give utterance to this monologue: “Self-esteem!
Self-esteem! Too much self-esteem. That’s
what’s the matter!”</p>

<p>I wondered to whom he referred, and after waiting
a few seconds to see if he had any more to say, I
asked him if he were speaking to me. “No, no, Padre,”
he exclaimed. “I’m thinking of those fellows this
evening. Did you see them when Canon Scott invited
them out to the communion? Only about half a dozen
went, out of all the crowd. Self-esteem, self-esteem—that’s
it!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied, “I didn’t notice. I asked my men—I
had only thirteen in the draft—if they wished to
go to the sacraments of their church, and immediately
the thirteen followed me down to the trench.”</p>

<p>He looked at me keenly and there was not the slightest
rancor in his voice as he spoke again: “That’s it,
Padre! That’s it! Of course your men would go!
That’s to be expected.” A kind of musing note came
into his voice, as he continued: “What is the secret?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
What is the secret? They don’t fear you. Indeed,
they love you.”</p>

<p>I told him as clearly as I could the secret, and as he
continued smoking quietly, I felt how truly he had
spoken of our Catholic lads. How they loved the
priest, how on battlefield or muddy trench their eyes
lighted with love as the priest drew near. No wonder
thirteen men followed me down to the trench: they
knew what I could do for them. They knew in a few
minutes they would be friends with Christ; that He
would visit them, abide in their souls. They were so
absorbed in the sublimity of what was to take place
that no thought of what others might say flashed across
their minds. There was no human respect there.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXXIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Boves Again</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The first Sunday on the Amiens front we had no
church parade. But the second Sunday we managed
to have one for the lads out of the trenches. We had
Mass on a wooded hill that had been heavily shelled
during the week by the Germans, though they left us
quiet on Sunday.</p>

<p>There was a huge crippled tank on the hill, and
workmen were busy repairing it. I found a rough
table placed against the tank, and on the table a portable
altar already set up for Mass; grouped about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
this were some men from other brigades and a few
of my own men, with a draft that had come for the
Thirteenth. Father MacDonnell had just finished Mass.
He and Father Fallon heard confessions, and the workmen
repaired the tank, while I offered up the Holy
Sacrifice for the men.</p>

<p>The following Friday evening, after a long, weary
march, we came back into Boves. It was a different
looking city from the one we had entered almost three
weeks before. On the outskirts, high on a hill, dozens
of great marquee tents rose in the darkening twilight,
and from a large flag-staff waved, on a white background,
the red cross: it was one of our Canadian clearing
stations that had moved up. We came around a
turn in the road and there, standing in a group, were
the nurses, orderlies, and many patients from the tents
on the hill. They cheered and cheered as the lads
marched by and the nurses fluttered their white handkerchiefs,
while the band played a merry march. Down
the street of the city the merry pipers piped our way,
while house after house opened its doors wide and the
good French people who had returned, whole families
of them, came out and cheered us as we passed up the
street. I had a fine billet in the class-room of a school
just next door to the church; yet it seemed somewhat
stuffy and closed in after having lived for almost three
weeks in an apple orchard.</p>

<p>The following morning, after I came in from Mass,
I noticed the cook standing on the outer sill of the
window, looking closely at the grape-vines which grew
up the sides of the building; many bunches of white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
grapes grew among the thick green leaves. A few
minutes later, as I sat down to breakfast, George
walked in with a great cluster, almost as large as a
pineapple, on a dish and placed them near my plate.</p>

<p>All day long I was hoping to have the opportunity
of having my men to confession before leaving Boves,
for it was being rumored about the city that we were
on our way back to the Arras front where we were to
take part in other big battles. I could not learn from
headquarters at what time we were to leave, but I
surmised it would be early Sunday morning. I was
praying the Blessed Virgin to let me have the men, but
at seven o’clock p. m. it seemed certain that we were
to move early in the morning.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the quartermaster came to me, saying:
“The move’s off, Padre. We don’t leave here till
tomorrow evening.”</p>

<p>I called George, and soon he and I were out organizing
a church parade of all the troops in the city. I
called at the C. C. S. on the hill, thinking there might
be a chaplain there who could help me with confessions.
I learned that there was a Catholic chaplain
attached to the unit, but that at present he was absent
on leave.</p>

<p>I heard confessions for about an hour before Mass,
but as the time for Mass drew near it became evident
that I would not be able to hear one-quarter of the
great throng of khaki-clad lads that filled the church;
all the pews were filled and many were standing. When
the hour for Mass had come, even the large sanctuary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
was filled with soldiers, some of them wearing the blue
uniform of France.</p>

<p>I was just about to leave the confessional to say
Mass when I heard some one knocking on the door.
I looked up quickly: there stood Father MacDonnell
in his Scotch uniform. I was so overjoyed that I stepped
out quickly and cried: “The Blessed Virgin sent
you here!”</p>

<p>He looked at me with his shrewd, kind eyes, and
there was not the shadow of a smile in them as he
said: “Never mind, now, who sent me here. What can
I do for you?”</p>

<p>I asked him which he preferred, to say Mass or to
hear confessions. He said he had already said Mass
and had taken his breakfast. So I asked him if he
would kindly hear confessions.</p>

<p>I walked up the aisle towards the altar, past row
and row of those great-hearted Catholic lads, and as
I went I thanked the Blessed Virgin for what she had
done. But it was a little too early: she had not yet
finished answering my prayers, for just as I entered
the sanctuary I noticed one of the French soldiers sitting
on a bench reading his Breviary. I touched him
on the shoulder and asked him if he were a priest.</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>Then I asked him if he would hear the French confessions,
for more than half the men of the Fourteenth
Battalion were French. He closed his Breviary, after
he had marked the place with a colored ribbon. Then
he bowed and said he would.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>About two years after the Armistice had been signed
I was travelling in New Brunswick when a young man
came down the car to shake hands with me. He had
been one of the officers of the Fourteenth Battalion assisting
at Mass in the church at Boves that Sunday.
After we had talked a little while, he remarked:
“Father, I have often thought of that Sunday at
Boves. It seemed to me a beautiful thing to see officers
of high rank going over and kneeling down at
the feet of one clad in the uniform of a French private
of the ranks to have their sins absolved.”</p>

<p>Just before Mass I announced that during the celebration
of the Holy Sacrifice Father MacDonnell would
hear confessions in English while the French Father
would hear the French confessions, and that after
Mass, if there were still some who had not gone to
confession, the two priests would continue to hear and
I would help them. I added that confessions would
be heard and communion given again that afternoon.</p>

<p>I said my Mass slowly and preached about twenty
minutes. During my sermon I saw something that
gratified me very much. Among the officers of one of
the battalions was one whom I had never seen at the
sacraments. I had approached him some time before,
and had met the greatest rebuff I had ever received
from a Catholic: he told me quite gruffly that he had
no time for that kind of thing. His words had actually
struck me dumb for a few seconds, so that I walked
away from him without saying anything further. But
as I preached that Sunday at Boves, looking out over
that sea of reverent faces, I saw the officer stand up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
and walk reverently to the confessional, and when I
gave Holy Communion I saw him at the rails.</p>

<p>As I write these words there stands on the little
table before me a tiny plaster statue of the Immaculate
Conception. Since I began writing this story it has
been always present on the table. It was given to me
by a soldier of the Fourteenth Battalion just after the
Battle of Amiens. Cut into the base of the statue is
the one word “Boves,” and the dents made by the letters
are filled with the red clay of France. I will
keep this statue always, for it brings back memories
of a town where great things were done for God among
my Canadian soldiers, and of her who brought these
things about.</p>

<p>That evening, as I entered the class-room that was
my billet, two figures looked up quickly: one was
George, who had a right to be there; the other was
one of the assistants in the veterinary section. There
was a very strong odor of iodoform in the room. On
a bench between the two soldiers was my wash-basin
filled with some solution, and the little dog, who had
broken his paw, was having it washed in the solution.</p>

<p>I said nothing. I was not even cross, for I knew how
difficult it was to procure a vessel in which to wash
dogs’ broken paws.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXXIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Battle of Arras</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Our journey was uneventful, save that we were derailed
at St. Paul; no one, however, was killed. All
along our journey we spoke of the Battle of Amiens,
“the greatest isolated victory to the credit of Canadian
arms.” It had taken but five days to free Amiens
and its railway. The allied troops engaged in the
battle were one American division, five Australian divisions,
four Canadian divisions and four English divisions.
There were also four hundred tanks and three
British cavalry divisions. These troops had met and
routed twenty German divisions, and taken twenty-two
thousand prisoners and over four hundred guns.
The line was advanced twelve miles from points held
at the hour of attack on August 8th.</p>

<p>Of these totals the Canadians claimed ten thousand
prisoners, nearly one hundred and seventy guns, one
thousand machine-guns, over one hundred trench mortars,
and great quantities of other materials. They had
freed over sixty miles of territory. They had been the
apex of the wedge that attacked. It was, indeed, a
great victory! Later, I read in Hindenburg’s account
of the war, entitled “Out of My Life” (Harper &amp;
Brothers, New York), the following:</p>

<p>“I had no illusions about the political effects of our
defeat on August 8th. Our battles from July 15th to
August 4th could be regarded, both abroad and at
home, as the consequence of an unsuccessful but bold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
stroke, such as may happen in any war. On the other
hand, the failure of August 8th was revealed to all
eyes as the consequences of an open weakness. To fail
in an attack was a very different matter from being
vanquished on the defense. The amount of booty
which our enemy could publish to the world, spoke a
clear language. Both the public at home and our
allies could only listen in great anxiety. All the more
urgent was it that we should keep our presence of mind
and face the situation without illusions, but also without
exaggerated pessimism.</p>

<p>“The military situation had certainly become serious.
Of course the position on the part of our front
which had been attacked could be restored, the lost
war material made good, and fresh reserves brought up.
But all this did not exhaust the effects of our defeat.
We could only expect that, encouraged by his great
victory, our enemy would now open similar attacks at
other points.” (Vol. II, pp. 217 and 218.)</p>

<p>This is just what we did. On August 26th the Second
Canadian Division had opened the Battle of Arras
and, as we hastened towards them, were in the thick
of the fight.</p>

<p>We detrained at Aubigny and were taken from there
to Arras in busses.</p>

<p>During the night of August 28th we moved up from
the ruins of Arras to relieve the Second Division. We
had been waiting in reserve at Arras. Already the
Second Division had been gaining victories. Before
September 1st we had gained a minor engagement or
two.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>On the morning of September 1st I received word
that we were preparing for a great attack; we were
to break the Drocourt Quéant line. The line had been
accounted impregnable, for the whole system was the
result of years of patient toil on the part of the Germans.
In the attack, the Canadian Corps was to be
the battering ram of the advance.</p>

<p>The night of September 1st was very dark, and rain
fell as the men assembled for the attack. Zero hour
was to be 5 a. m. Captain Shea, one of the medical
officers of the First Field Ambulance, with whom I
was going to work the following day, found a square
hole in the ground about two feet deep, and he and I
rolled ourselves in our blankets and tried to sleep. The
Germans were shelling this area very hard and shells
were dropping all about us, and the rain upon us.
Every little while I could hear the doctor, who was a
very devout Catholic, give voice to the following soliloquy:
“Think of a priest lying out in the mud a night
like this! What awful times we are living in! I wonder
what his people at home would say if they could see
him now. A priest sleeping in a mud-hole!”</p>

<p>Then, perhaps, a shell would drop very near us and
I could hear him say, optimistically: “Well, the worst
we can expect is to be buried alive!”</p>

<p>I could not help laughing as the doctor continued.
Everything seemed so strange to him, for he had but
lately come to the front. And I had now been long
enough in the army to take things as they came.</p>

<p>At five o’clock a. m. the earth began to thunder and
rock as the terrible barrage began that was to sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the death-knell of the Drocourt Quéant line. We
watched the men advance, then we were busy with
the wounded. A great number passed through our
hands, including some Irish lads from the Naval Division
on our right. It took but an hour or two for the
Canadians to break the Drocourt Quéant line which
had been considered impregnable. Passing through
the trenches and over the battlefield that day, I marvelled
at the system of deep trenches from which led
great dugouts lighted with electricity. We encountered
many wounded Germans lying in shell-holes, and dispatched
German prisoners to bring them to the Field
Ambulance that had now been established near Cagnicourt.</p>

<p>We had not been shelled very much that day, but
two or three days before, in one of the minor engagements,
the shelling had been terrific. George and I
had run the gauntlet of shell-fire known as a “creeping
barrage.” Wall after wall of bursting shells had
swept over us, killing nearly all our companions. George
and two privates and I were the only ones out of fourteen
who were not casualties.</p>

<p>Towards evening, as I was anointing some German
wounded, one of our prisoners, an officer, stepped over
and began to speak to the lad to whom I was administering.
The officer told me in French that he would
interpret, as he was a Catholic. I asked him to try to
dispose the dying soldier for absolution. He did, and
then helped me while I anointed the lad.</p>

<p>When I was through I thanked the officer for his
aid and remarked that he seemed well grounded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
his religion. He smiled a little at this, as he said: “I
should be, for I am an ordained deacon.” I was still
talking to this young ecclesiastic when I heard a
friendly call from a stretcher, and, looking in that direction,
I saw it was Lt. Maxwell-Scott—he who had
first served my Mass at Fosse-dix. It seemed years
ago. He was wounded, though not seriously.</p>

<p>The following day I waited, with an Anglican chaplain
from the Third Brigade, till all the dead were
brought in from the battlefield. Among the officers of
the Sixteenth were two or three of my dear friends.
One was the gentle officer who had slept in my billet
at Carency, months before—the one who had been
called “Wild Bill;” even in death there was a gentle
expression on his kind face. We buried one hundred
and twenty-five that day, and called the place “Dominion
Cemetery.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>We remained in this area till September 4th, and
each night we were bombed almost continuously. It
was terrible and there were many casualties. One
could scarcely count the airplanes. We could hear
them coming from a great distance and each moment
drawing nearer and nearer. We would lie on the
ground unprotected—nothing between us and the airplanes
but the thin sheets of our bivouacs. When they
would arrive over our camping ground, great lights resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
arc light would drop slowly down, lighting
up the entire area. Then would come in quick succession
the awful crash of bursting bombs. Often I have
gripped the grass beside me with both hands, as I lay
there waiting to be blown into a thousand fragments.
Then, one fleet of ’planes having exhausted its supply
of bombs there would be relative silence till the next
was heard approaching. During the interim, slowly,
silently, and anxiously, our searchlights swept the sky,
the great long shafts of light crossing and recrossing
each other.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Berneville Again</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“When they had a day or two of good sleep, regular
meals and rest, they seemed quickly to forget all they
had suffered, even their mental torture. Of course,
for this purpose the rest had to be real rest, undisturbed
by enemy shells and bombs, and, if possible,
somewhere where the thunder of the guns could not
be heard.”</p>

<p>I quote these words from the second volume of “Out
of My Life” by Von Hindenburg, for they apply to
all soldiers. The Germans had retreated to the opposite
bank of the Canal du Nord, where they were prepared
to defend themselves stoutly. To carry a position
like the Canal du Nord, careful plans must first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
be made. Our troops were tired, and they needed a
rest; therefore, on being relieved we came out to the
areas about Arras and the Sixteenth came to Berneville.</p>

<p>“The operations which broke the Drocourt Quéant
Line closed with the departure of the victors. These
men had accomplished great deeds. They had won a
great moral victory, which had far-reaching effects.
They had conquered a trench system of which the world
had spoken with bated breath in one triumphant rush.
Many material things had passed from the enemy’s
possession into theirs. Among these should be numbered
eight thousand prisoners, sixty-five guns and
four hundred and seventy-five machine-guns. Their
line was only seven miles from Cambrai.” (From
“The Canadians in France,” by Captain Harwood
Steel—Copp Clark Co.)</p>

<p>The above quotation was written of us. So we came
out to Berneville to rest. Those days of September
were very pleasant at Berneville. Roses still bloomed
in the garden of the old curé, with whom I was again
billeted; grapes were plentiful all over the countryside.
They grew in the garden of the old house where we
had our mess and often they were served at our meals.
Every morning when I came back from breakfast to my
billet I found on the table a large yellow, red-cheeked
pear. These little acts of kindness of the old curé’s
sister used to affect me almost to tears. I think the
awful strain of battle was beginning to affect us all.
I said Mass every morning in the church and a young
fellow from the Fifteenth—which was also quartered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
in Berneville—used to serve it. Every morning he
went to Holy Communion.</p>

<p>The old sister of the curé seemed very much interested
in the young man, for she also attended my Mass
and received Holy Communion daily. She used to talk
to me about him and say he must be a brother from
some religious community. So one morning I asked
the lad his name. He was James Diamond, and his
home was in Philadelphia—another of my Canadian
lads who hailed from the United States. He was not
a member of any religious community though he had
two brothers who were priests. I told the old lady
this, and although she was somewhat disappointed to
learn that the young man was not a religious, still
she was delighted to know that he had two brothers
who were priests.</p>

<p>I visited my battalions every day and we had confessions
every evening. The men came in great numbers.
Although we were in rest, the lads knew by the
training they were undergoing that another attack was
imminent.</p>

<p>During the day I often walked up and down the old
rose garden of the curé. It was a beautiful old garden
with high stone walls, against which pear trees
and peach trees had been trained to grow so that the
branches spread out against the wall. There were
roses here of almost every variety. Often, as I walked
up and down the paths of the garden reading my Breviary,
I stopped and gazed for a long time on the wonderful
beauty before me. Soon we would be into the
war again!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Letters of Sympathy</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>During these days of rest I devoted a large portion
of every morning to writing letters of sympathy to
relatives of those who had fallen in the recent attacks.
I had many of these letters to write, and I always
went to work with a heavy heart; but it was always
very consoling to receive the wonderful replies that
came. I quote from a few that I managed to keep,
although the reader will learn later that I lost nearly
all my possessions before the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>This one comes from Morningside Avenue, New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Reverend dear Father:</p>

<p>Your comforting letter has just been received. Father, words
would be useless to try to express what relief and consolation
your message brought, for naturally my heart ached, wondering
whether my poor son had an opportunity to offer up his
repentance before God took him.</p>

<p>The cross is indeed a heavy one to bear, but with the knowledge
contained in your letter and the fact that his sacrifice
was made for so glorious a cause, I shall reconcile myself to
the will of Almighty God, and pray for the repose of his soul.</p>

<p>My daily prayers shall indeed be offered for you, Father, who
brought such happiness to my heart, and for your many soldier
boys.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Very sincerely yours,</span></p>
</div>

<p>The next is from Frontenac Street, Montreal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Reverend and dear Father:</p>

<p>Words fail to convey how soothing was the intelligence that
previous to his last attack my son had had the happiness of
receiving our dear Lord, and that after he had paid the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
“Supreme Sacrifice” he had one of God’s representatives near
him. In life he was devoted to religion, in death he must
assuredly be happy with God. But to us who are left it has
been a crushing blow, and especially to me, his mother, to
whom a kinder and more dutiful son never was given.</p>

<p>Our Lady of Sorrows is certainly the one to turn to in this
hour of trial, for she likewise gave up her son. So, like her,
I shall endeavor to carry my cross, but I fear it shall not be
carried so well.</p>

<p>And now, dear Father, allow me to extend to you my most
sincere thanks. You will always be remembered in the prayers
of his sorrowing mother.</p>
</div>

<p>The next is from Grimsary, England:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dear Father Murdoch:</p>

<p>I should feel I was neglecting a great duty if I did not
write a line to thank you for your kindness in informing us
of my dear brother’s death. R. I. P. It was indeed a great
consolation to know that he received Holy Communion before
going into battle, also to know that he was buried in a cemetery.
We shall be ever grateful to you for your kindness and
for your prayers.</p>

<p>With every best wish for your safety, I am,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours sincerely,</span></p>
</div>

<p>The next is from Gilford P. O. Co. Down, Ireland:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dear Rev. Father:</p>

<p>It is with a sad heart I write to thank you for your consoling
letter to my mother concerning the death of my poor
brother. Your letter gives us all strength to bear our heavy
burden of sorrow. It is hard to think that he has really gone
from us. But God’s will be done! We all lift our hearts in
thanksgiving to know that he was prepared to die. He was a
good boy, and his youngest sister will miss him. My mother
is in great sorrow at the loss of her only son. She has had
great trouble, as my father died when we were very young.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
But God will give her strength to bear and persevere until
we shall all meet never to part.</p>

<p>Dear Rev. Father, I will close this letter now and I wish
you to know that all of us will never forget you in our prayers.
And I earnestly implore of God to reward you for all you
have done for my poor brother and for us, and that our Most
Holy Mother will intercede for your safety through this suffering
you are enduring.</p>

<p>I am going to confession and Communion Sunday for your
intentions. Always remember that there are three hearts raised
to God night and morning imploring His blessings and mercy
for you.</p>

<p>Thanking you again, Father, I wish to remain your grateful
friend who will never forget you.</p>
</div>

<p>This one from a non-Catholic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Rev. B. J. Murdoch,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I received your very kind letter today. Thank you so much
for writing. Although I am not of the Catholic faith, I know
just how much he would value your services before going into
battle.</p>

<p>God sends us a cross to bear, no matter what faith we own.
I will remember you and the other soldiers who are fighting
in my prayers just the same. I will write and tell his father
of your kindness, and ask him to thank you.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that I belong to the Church of England, but
that does not make any difference, for God hears all prayers.
I shall pray for you and your boys and teach our little girl
to do the same.</p>

<p>Kindly pardon any mistakes, and believe me to remain very
grateful to you for your sympathy.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours sincerely,</span></p>
</div>

<p>These are but samples of letters from different countries
that I received during the campaign. The people
seemed most grateful to me for writing. True, the censor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
prevented me from saying much that I should like
to have said; but always I was free to write what I had
done for the lads in my ministry. Sometimes I have
written many letters at a time, and for this reason the
message sent was brief. I shall try to give the reader
a sample of the simple letter that evoked such grateful
replies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dear Mrs. ——</p>

<p>No doubt you have already received from the War Office
the sad news of your son’s death. I am writing these
words to let you know that just before the battle of ——
I gave all the soldiers of his unit Holy Communion in a little
shell-torn church on the Western Front.—If I had anointed
him I would add this, and if it were I who had laid him to rest
I would say—I buried him in a peaceful military cemetery behind
the lines, far from the sound of the guns. This knowledge
should give you some consolation in carrying the heavy
cross that God has sent you to bear.</p>

<p>I shall remember your son’s soul in the Holy Sacrifice of
the Mass, and I shall ask Our Lady of Sorrows to pray for you
that you may be comforted.</p>

<p>Asking you to pray for my lads and for me, I am</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours sincerely in Christ,</span><br />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXXVII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">A Little Bit of Shamrock</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although I had many letters to write, this did not
keep me from having a little enjoyment. We had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
been very long in rest billets when it was announced
that the Sixteenth Canadian Battalion concert party
was to put on soon the play entitled “A Little Bit
of Shamrock.” This was the play the soldiers were
practising while we were at Monchy Breton, and because
of the fact that one of the characters was a
priest I was very anxious to see the play.</p>

<p>The concert party was to be with us three nights,
so I hoped to be able to attend at least one performance.
The company had been playing for the large
base hospitals while we were taking part in the recent
heavy fighting. I had met a Presbyterian chaplain
in Arras who told me that he had seen the play and
that it was one of the finest in France. They had
been furnished with hundreds of dollars’ worth of
scenery and costumes. So we looked forward with
pleasure to seeing it.</p>

<p>I noticed as I worked among the men that the rest
was doing them very much good. The village streets
used to ring with laughter and merry jokes, especially
in the evening. It was wonderful how much like boys
those soldiers would become, given a few days’ rest.</p>

<p>I remember one day, while sitting in the mess waiting
for lunch to be served, listening to an animated
conversation going on among a group of soldiers, of
which George was the dominating spirit. George held
in his hand a pair of German field-glasses which evidently
he wished to barter for something some
other soldier had. The other soldier thought George
had placed a too high valuation on the glasses, and
their voices rose and fell in debate. Finally, all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
voices were silent; then the voice of George sounded
clear and distinct, as he said impressively: “Gentlemen,
I tell you, these glasses are so powerful that they
will bring a church, miles distant, so near that you
can actually hear the church bells ringing in the
tower!”</p>

<p>Although a few derisive groans greeted this statement,
the great bursts of merry laughter that accompanied
them did my heart good and showed me how
light-hearted were the troops.</p>

<p>A day or two following the episode of the field-glasses,
I was again sitting in the mess waiting for
lunch to be served. The transport officer and quartermaster
were with me. Suddenly the lieutenant who
had been billeting officer when we were at Ecoivres
walked in and sat down. He had a little business
with the quartermaster, and as he stated it his eyes
turned towards the table, which was set for lunch, and
rested longingly on a dish of cold bread-pudding with
raisins in it. The pudding was cut in pieces resembling
in size and shape an ordinary helping of Washington
pie; there were three slices in all. Now, I
never liked bread-pudding, not even in war time;
neither did the other two officers of the mess. So
when the billeting officer made known to us his weakness
for bread-pudding we gave him a most pressing
invitation to have a piece. He took one piece, and as
he ate it with great relish we could not help smiling.
He stopped for a second or two and looked around
on us. “My,” he said, “I like this! Our cook never
thinks of giving us anything like this.” Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
continued earnestly to devote his attention to the
pudding.</p>

<p>We offered him another piece, and with boyish delight
he accepted it. When he had finished this, I
offered him the remaining slice. The other two officers
were now laughing.</p>

<p>“Ah, Padre!” he said reproachfully, but his eye
wavered and his hand without any apparent reluctance
reached out and took the third piece.</p>

<p>He stayed for a little while longer, and I wondered
if he could be quite well after eating so great a quantity
of such soggy food. I began, indeed, to feel a
slight twinge of conscience. Perhaps I should not
have offered him that last thick slice of heavy bread-pudding.
He was now quiet, and for a second or two
a far-away look came into his eyes. Then, suddenly,
he seemed to recollect something. He stood up quickly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I think it is about time for me
to be going home to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Will he be all right?” I asked the other officers,
as he disappeared on his way.</p>

<p>“Sure,” they both said, and then the quartermaster
Continued: “Why, Padre, that’s just a little <i>hors
d’oeuvres</i> for him, just a little appetizer, just enough to
convince him that it’s time to take a little substantial
food.” Then, as we lunched, they told me such wonderful
stories of this officer’s capacity for food that
I laughed and laughed all through the meal.</p>

<p>I could not attend the play till the third evening;
George, who had gone both nights, seemed very anxious
that I should see it. I had tea with the concert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
party the afternoon of the third day and in the evening
I went to the play, and was given a very good
seat.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that play given by those splendid
boys on the Western Front. Even as I write these
words the tears come to my eyes as they did that
night, but they are tears of joy. It was a wonderful
play—wonderful in its presentation, wonderful, especially,
in its beautiful interpretation of the character
of the Catholic priest—bubbling with gaiety and
gladness, and spotless humor. I was transported with
joy and amazement.</p>

<p>The curtain rose, disclosing the library of an Irish
priest’s house, through the open window of which
came in excellent harmony the sound of male voices
singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent2">“Och, Father O’Flynn, you’ve a wonderful way wid you.</div>
<div class="verse">All ould sinners are wishful to pray wid you,</div>
<div class="verse">All the young children are wild for to play wid you,</div>
<div class="verse">You’ve such a way wid you, Father avick!</div>
<div class="verse">Still for all you’ve so gentle a soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Gad, you’ve your flock in the grandest control:</div>
<div class="verse">Checking the crazy ones, coaxing unaisy ones,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifting the lazy ones on with the stick.</div>
<div class="indent2">Here’s a health for you, Father O’Flynn,</div>
<div class="indent2">Slanté and slanté and slanté agin,</div>
<div class="indent2">Pow’rfulest preacher and tindirest teacher</div>
<div class="indent2">And kindliest creature in ould Donegal.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the last sounds of the chorus died away, a young
Irish girl, attired in typical colleen fashion, and a boy
of about nineteen or twenty, in knee-breeches, entered.
The colleen was a perfect impersonation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
young man, who carried a gun and an empty game-bag,
had returned from the chase. He was telling
Molly how many birds he had seen and how many
he might have shot had it not been for—etc., etc.
The more voluble Shaun became, the more Molly
shrugged her shoulders. It seemed Shaun had often
hunted before, and had often come “very near hitting
a bird.”</p>

<p>Just as good-natured Shaun was becoming more eloquent
and Molly more disdainful, a stately old figure
in cassock and cincture walked slowly into the room,
carrying his breviary and biretta. There was a look
of benign interest on his face as he regarded Shaun
and Molly. The two greeted the priest warmly, in true
Irish fashion; yet the three actors were non-Catholics.</p>

<p>I am certain I did not follow the plot of the play.
I was too delighted with Father O’Flynn. He was
the ideal priest, genial, kind, grave. He possessed all
those lovable qualities that we Catholics always associate
with the priesthood. I was really delighted with
the impersonation of the character. Where had he, the
actor, acquired his wonderful knowledge of the priesthood?
If it had been a play that the lads had procured
already written, I would not have been so surprised;
but they themselves had composed it.</p>

<p>There was one scene that was almost uncanny in
its faithful reproduction of one of the little dialogues
that take place often in the office of a country parish
priest. Old Mrs. Nolan—off the stage “she” was
Private M. Dawes, No. 1 Platoon, Sixteenth Battalion,
and in civil life an actor who had taken parts with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the great Du Maurier—had come to call on Father
O’Flynn concerning her husband, who was not working,
and who for reasons known only to himself had
no inclination to work. She spoke quietly at first,
but gradually, animated by righteous indignation, a
certain piquancy and forcefulness colored her words.
She had just begun rightly to denounce “himself”
when Father O’Flynn, with a gentle raising of one
hand from his knee, where it had rested palm downwards,
said softly: “There, now, Mrs. Nolan! There,
now! Don’t mind, it will be all right! It will be all
right. In a little while Timmy’ll be at work again.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Nolan, somewhat mollified, would concede:
“Yis, Father! Yis, Father! Perhaps you’re
right, Father. Indade, he’s not so bad; if he would
stay away from that Dinny O’Shea, he might be better.
And look, Father dear, I wouldn’t be mindin’ what
that Liz of his would ever be saying. Look here,
Father, if she’d stay at home and look after her man
and not go galavantin’ over the parish! Look here,
Father, she’s one of the worst—”</p>

<p>Then with a gentle smile Father O’Flynn would
again quiet the indignant Mrs. Nolan. But she was
irrepressible. And as she continued her rapid-fire
talk, the house roared with laughter, so that we forgot
that we were in a building on the Western Front
into which at any minute a long-distance shell might
fall, killing and wounding half the people there. We
forgot this completely as we continued to enjoy one
of the finest plays ever staged on the Western Front.</p>

<p>As I looked on, laughing heartily, another emotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
began to manifest itself; gradually, as I listened to
the dialogue, the whole setting before me took on a
certain familiarity: it was a priest’s room, my own
language was being spoken, a scene was being enacted
with which every priest is familiar. I felt as if I
saw my Catholic people at home; then a kind of mist
seemed to pass over me, and my eyes filled up—yes,
gentle reader, I was lonesome!</p>

<p>The old curé and his sister had waited up for me,
to hear about the play. I had told them before leaving
that I was going to see a non-Catholic take the
part of a Catholic priest, and they had been very
interested. They were like two children in their delight
when I came bursting in on them with the news
of the play. They rejoiced with me when I told them
how splendidly the part of Father O’Flynn had been
taken by one of the lads. The old lady seemed the
more enthusiastic of the two, until I told the story
of Mrs. Nolan, then the curé broke into rippling laughter;
but Madame just smiled quietly. We talked for
a long time that evening for the three of us were very
pleased. I had told them before going that I had my
fears lest the actor assigned the part of the priest
should not interpret it according to the best traditions
of the priesthood. But now they were quite relieved,
and very joyful when I told them that the play
would be shown wherever there were Canadian soldiers
in France.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Left Behind</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>I was well satisfied with my work among the soldiers
during these evenings and we were all benefiting
very much by our rest. But we did not know just
how soon we would be going into action. One evening
towards seven o’clock, on coming back to Berneville
after having attended a meeting at corps headquarters,
I found men of the Fourth Division walking up and
down the street. I was somewhat surprised at this,
for when I had left in the morning the village had been
occupied only by First Division troops. Now I saw
no men of the Third Brigade. I stopped the first
soldier I met and asked him where was the Sixteenth.</p>

<p>He told me he did not know, that the Sixteenth had
“pulled out” about four o’clock and that another
battalion had “taken over” these lines.</p>

<p>I went quickly to the place our mess had been, only
to find other officers occupying it. They were just
about to sit down to dinner, and invited me to remain,
but I was too eager to have news of my troops. This
was the first time they had ever stolen a march on
me.</p>

<p>I opened the gate of the old curé’s garden, hoping
to see George standing in the twilight somewhere
among the roses; but there was no khaki-clad figure
there. In fact, there was no one in the garden; everything
was very quiet. Knocking on the door which led
to the office and dining-room combined, I advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
into the lamp-lit room to find the curé and his sister
just about to sit down to their evening meal. They
welcomed me warmly. It was good to see the kindly,
beaming faces of my old friends; and as my eyes wandered
from them to the table I saw that places had
been set for three.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the old priest as he motioned me to
the seat beside him. “Come, you are just in time,
for we were about to begin, fearing you would not
arrive.”</p>

<p>I sat down quickly, for I did not wish to delay any
longer these good people. The memory of that evening
is still very vivid; the low, lamp-lit room, with
its quaint engravings on the wall, the old-fashioned
furniture, the spotless white linen cloth, heavy silver
and thick china, with blue scroll-work bordering of
old chateaux and rustic-bridged streams. A large roll
of coarse though wholesome brown bread, such as I
had seen old “Mamma Katzenjammer” make some
time before, was on a plate in the middle of the table,
and beside this was a black-handled bread knife; a
huge bottle of golden cider stood near the bread. Opposite
me was a wooden bowl of salad and a large
wooden fork and spoon.</p>

<p>Madame brought from the kitchen a small brown
earthenware casserole and placed it before M. le Curé.
The removal of the cover disclosed three plump little
pigeons. Simultaneously M. le Curé and Madame
looked at me. “In your honor,” said the priest as
both bowed, jokingly.</p>

<p>I remembered how, when a boy, I had shot a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
pigeons, which when cooked I was unable to eat, because
they were so tough. But the pigeons of old
Madame were not tough. Indeed, I had never eaten
any meat more tender. They had been pot roasted.</p>

<p>It was one of the pleasantest evenings I had ever
spent in rest billets. As we sat at table they told
me that the battalion had left for the front at four
o’clock. George had packed my bed-roll, and had
placed it and my portable altar on the general service
wagon, leaving my haversack with articles I would
need for the night. He had left word that we would
not be going into action for a day or two and that I
would be quite safe in staying that night in Berneville.</p>

<p>As we sat talking in the quiet lamp-lit room, and I
realized all that was before me, I could not help thinking
how pleasant it would be to live on in this peaceful
old house, far from the horrors of war, and preach to
the quiet peasants, and teach them the ways of God.
But quickly I put this thought from my mind. The
Master for whom I labored had sterner work for me
to do. And tomorrow morning early I must leave, to
go once more into The Red Vineyard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter LXXXIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">With the Fourteenth</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Early the following morning after Mass I said “au
revoir” to the old priest and his sister, who walked
down to the gate to see me off.</p>

<p>On the way, fearing it might be evening before I
would find my battalion, I bought an ordinary three-ounce
tin of sardines and paid sixty-five cents for it;
but I never ate it. I had the great good fortune to
meet a lorry, going towards the front, which brought
me to within a few hundred yards of the Sixteenth
Battalion, which was camped in a wide green valley.
I was fortunate in finding my unit, but soon I was to
learn of what was the first of a series of misfortunes.</p>

<p>George met me as I came along and there was a look
in his face that I had never seen there before.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir, but I have bad news for you,” he
said. “Your bed-roll and all your belongings have
been burned.”</p>

<p>Poor George turned his face away. It really hurt
him to have to tell anything so unpleasant.</p>

<p>“My portable altar, too, George?” I questioned, as
fear tugged at my heart.</p>

<p>George turned towards me, his face brightening.</p>

<p>“No, sir. We saved that. Everything in the little
church is all right.” George always called the altar
the “little church.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell me that a fire had broken
out, during the night, in the corrugated iron hut where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
I was to have slept, and that when it was discovered
it was too late to save two bed-rolls; he had managed,
however, to bring out one bed-roll and my portable
altar.</p>

<p>It was now late in September and the evenings were
becoming quite cold. I would miss very much my
blankets, cloak and overcoat, all of which, together
with many other articles, had been burned. I still
had my trench coat, which I was wearing at the time.</p>

<p>“Well, George,” I said finally, “it could have been
a great deal worse. I am very thankful that I did not
lose my trench coat.”</p>

<p>A few evenings later, while I was standing outside
my hut examining a new bicycle that had come to me
from headquarters, a runner came up and passed me
a D. R. L. S. letter. As I read it, I felt my hand
tremble. I was to report immediately to the Fourteenth
Battalion, where I was now attached for quarters
and rations; Captain the Rev. G. Colthurst was to
exchange places with me. He was a Church of England
chaplain.</p>

<p>That evening I left, my heart filled with regrets;
but a soldier must obey. I said good-bye to George,
although I hoped to see him often. He thanked me
for the way I had treated him, though I had only given
him the consideration which as a thorough gentleman
he deserved. I thanked him in return for all he had
done for me. Twice, if not oftener, during the recent
heavy fighting he had come through a terrific barrage
of shell-fire and gas to guide me to the transport mess.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
He had actually risked his life where he was not
bound to do so.</p>

<p>The second in command of the Fourteenth, Major
Price, welcomed me cordially to the battalion. The
colonel was then absent. Major Price, though a very
kind man with a most gentle disposition, held one of
the finest records in the army, rising from a private
in the ranks to be colonel of the battalion.</p>

<p>The officers of the Fourteenth were a fine lot of men,
yet they never filled the place in my affections that
the officers of the Sixteenth had won.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Telegraph Hill</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following Sunday I said Mass on Telegraph Hill.
It was a very high elevation and on all sides we could
see, far below, the great green valley. I counted as
many as six light railway trains steaming their way
from different points towards the front. I think we
were then about seven or eight miles from the Canal du
Nord, where the next big battle was to take place.
Some of the men came early and I stood talking to
them till all the soldiers, excepting the Thirteenth
Battalion, had come up. Thinking that there must be
some mistake in orders and that they had failed to receive
notice of church service, I began to say Mass.
I had a large crowd of lads and they were formed up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
very near the altar; some stood almost touching the
altar in order to keep the wind from extinguishing my
candles. Nearly all my men had received the Sacraments
while in rest, so I gave a general absolution today,
then all went to Holy Communion.</p>

<p>Just as I had given the last men Holy Communion
the Thirteenth came up, their pipe band playing merrily.
There was nothing left for me to do but say
another Mass for them. It was very gratifying to
notice, as I turned to make an announcement before beginning
the second Mass, that many of the men who
had received Holy Communion at the first Mass still
remained kneeling on the ground as they made their
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>During the second Mass a number of German airplanes
tried to fly near us, but from down in the valley
our anti-aircraft guns barked and shells shrieked upwards,
bursting near the ’planes. All the men of the
Thirteenth, after a general absolution, went to Holy
Communion.</p>

<p>I came down from Telegraph Hill that morning feeling
that my men were now ready, spiritually, for battle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XCI<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Canal Du Nord</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the night of September 26th we moved up to
the trenches just before the Canal du Nord. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
rainy night and quite dark. We marched a long time,
for our guides had lost their way. Finally, as we approached
the trenches, Verey lights hissed a trail of
light through the sky and as they broke to descend we
stood very still. Every little while orders came for
us to fall on our faces, and we lay motionless on
the ground listening to that strange, sweeping sound
of machine-gun bullets as they tore their way through
the air just above us.</p>

<p>Before we entered the trenches we had supposed all
the Germans to be on the opposite bank of Canal du
Nord. But we were not in the trenches very long till
we learned that there were machine-gun outposts on
our own side. Indeed, not forty-eight yards from
where we stood was a machine-gun nest. Every time
a flash-light would show, or some one would speak
above a whisper, there would be a rat-tat-tat from almost
beside us, and then a pattering of machine-gun
bullets. I listened to the grim preparations that were
being made to surround the nest just as soon as our
barrage would open up.</p>

<p>At 5:20 a. m. two thundering crashes from an
eighteen-pound gun broke the stillness, then the whole
barrage opened up, the like of which had never before
been heard on the Western Front. I quote below
from “The Canadians in France.”</p>

<p>“Never had the world known anything to compare
with the strength and majesty of that terrible artillery
fire. It was as if the pillars of the earth had fallen
and God had struck the Germans in his anger. The
gloom behind the advancing troops was blazing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
fire, and the gloom in front. The night overhead
shrieked and moaned and howled with the passing
of the shells, hurrying—hurrying—hurrying to keep
their appointment with death. The German machine-gunners
in the Canal and immediately behind it were
blown to pieces and the German guns were throttled
with their answers to their lips.”</p>

<p>We stood in the trenches listening to the terrible
roaring and crashing of the guns. When we spoke we
were obliged to yell in order to make ourselves heard.
It was still quite dark, yet all about us were sharp
yellow flashes of light from our guns. In a little while
the men were ready to start over the Canal. The
officer in command looked at me. “Coming, Padre?”
he asked. I smiled. I was not free to go then. I
must stay with the doctor, to attend the wounded that
would be brought in by the stretcher-bearers. Later
I was to go with the field ambulance.</p>

<p>Shortly after daylight I was moving along the
Canal looking for the Second Field Ambulance, with
which I was to follow, when I saw coming up through
a shower of shell explosions the young officer who
had come to see me at Monchy Breton. He was looking
for the Sixteenth Battalion. He was no longer
downhearted. The light of battle was in his clear
blue eye. He shook hands with me and smiled a
bright, fearless smile as the shells dropped about us.
He told me he had been sent up to the battalion, which
was sadly in need of officers. As he spoke, all about
us were dead men and horses.</p>

<p>I found the field ambulance at a cross-roads near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Inchy and I worked with them till noon. It was terrible
work, performed under great difficulties, as all
morning long a constant rain of enemy shells poured
over the roads. A great number of wounded passed
through. As the morning advanced, the day became
very warm. I took off my trench coat and began
to carry it on my arm. I remember laying it down
on the side of the road as I went to minister to a
wounded lad. When I had finished my work and
had wiped the blood from my hands on the thick
grass alongside of the road, I turned to pick up my
trench coat. It was no longer where I had put it. I
looked everywhere but I could not find it. It was a
very serviceable coat, lined with oiled silk and rubber
and impervious to rain and wind. Now I had no
coat whatsoever. My overcoat and cloak had been
burned, and now my trench coat was gone! I often
smile when I recall that morning. I worried more
at the time over the loss of what was in the pockets
than I did over the loss of the coat itself. In one
pocket was the tin of sardines that I had bought a
few days before. I had not yet broken my fast and
I did not know when I might do so. In the other
pocket was a “Baby Ben” alarm clock: it was very
useful sometimes when I wanted to sleep between
attacks. I never found the coat. I think some stretcher-bearers
must have placed it on a wounded man
thinking it had been left by some officer who had been
wounded or killed.</p>

<p>It was now the 27th of September and I was not
fitted out very well to stand the rigors of a fall campaign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Just before I left the Sixteenth I had been
given an old wagon cover, which George and I had
converted into a bed-roll, and I had been able to procure
two army blankets; but now I had no overcoat.</p>

<p>During a little lull in the afternoon I made my way
to headquarters of the Fourteenth, which was in a
dugout that the Germans had left them. There I had
some food, after which I made my way back to the
field ambulance.</p>

<p>That night I slept on the opposite side of the Canal
du Nord. We had gained another great victory and
had captured one of the strongest positions that the
enemy still held. Nearly five thousand prisoners had
been taken and about one hundred field-guns, together
with a great number of machine-guns and large quantities
of stores.</p>

<p>For several days one battle followed another; at
almost every hour of the day some brigade of the
Canadian corps was attacking. I followed with the
field ambulance and I was kept very busy.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Most Terrible Day</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>On Sunday I could not have a church parade, but
I said Mass in a bell tent near the Canal du Nord.
That morning I joined the First Field Ambulance in
a little village not very far from Cambrai. I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the name of the village was Raillencourt. As I approached
its outskirts, I saw that it was under fire.
Shell after shell was whistling over from the enemy
lines, bursting in black clouds of smoke and yellow
clouds of gas that mingled with red clouds of dust
rising from the ruined brick buildings. No traffic was
coming along the road. I must walk alone into the
village. My will said, Go! yet every nerve in my
body seemed to rebel; my feet were heavy as lead and
it seemed an effort for me to lift them from the ground.
I was now very tired from the work of the past week.
Almost sick with fear, I continued to advance. It
was a strange experience; my feet kept going heavily
forwards while the rest of me seemed to be trying to
hold them back. I felt that that hurt dazed look which
I had seen so often in the eyes of the men was in
my own eyes.</p>

<p>I remember going down the little street of the village
bewildered and almost stupefied while shells crashed
into buildings and the sickening fumes of gas poisoned
the air. Then, suddenly, I saw what I was in search
of—a little red cross on a white background, floating
from a window of a small house.</p>

<p>I entered the yard; a ruined field-kitchen lay in a
lake of porridge, and nearby, where they had carried
him to die, was the cook.</p>

<p>I found the cellar filled with wounded men with
whom the doctors were very busy. My old friend
Captain O’Shea was here and two other Catholic doctors.
I stayed in the cellar two days. Those were
horrible hours. I could not be relieved, as Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
O’Reilly of the Second Brigade had been wounded a
day or two before I came to the cellar. It was his
troops who were now in action. My own were back
in reserve. While I worked, Canon Scott, an Anglican
chaplain who had been in the war since the beginning,
was brought in wounded.</p>

<p>It was a miracle that we were not struck. At different
times during the day the Germans shelled the
little house heavily; many shells dropped in the garden
just outside the windows of the cellar. The nauseating
fumes from the gas shells penetrated into the
cellar and often we worked with our gas masks on.</p>

<p>At two o’clock Tuesday morning word came that
my brigade was going over the top near Haynecourt.
As soon as it was daylight, I left to join my troops.
I found the Second or Third Field Ambulance, which
was clearing that day at a cross-road near Cambrai.
I could see the city from where we worked. I was
very busy all day. At times the German airplanes
swooped low over us and swept our wounded with their
machine-guns. One poor fellow near me was riddled
with bullets and I had just time enough to prepare
him for death.</p>

<p>Towards three o’clock I felt something was wrong.
Wounded from the Fourteenth and Sixteenth were
no longer coming in. The men of the Fifteenth were
in reserve just behind where I worked. Seeing this,
I started forward. The shell-fire was intense, but I
prayed the Blessed Virgin to see me through. I met
a soldier from the Sixteenth who showed me where
the soldiers were, but he advised me not to go any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
farther. I’m afraid I was too worried about my men
at the moment to heed advice of this kind.</p>

<p>I found a number of them in a cutting of a railway,
together with a lot of other troops. The battle was
not going well; many members of the Fourteenth, cut
off, had been taken prisoners. The young officer did
not know where the rest were. I stayed with them,
crouching in little holes in the side of the sunken road,
and read my Breviary while the clay scattered by
bursting shells fell on its open pages.</p>

<p>Presently, I joined a party of stretcher-bearers going
out upon the field. The shelling was terrible as
we passed down the cutting of the railroad. I was
now getting among machine-gunners of the Third
Division who had their guns set up in the side of the
cutting.</p>

<p>The stretcher-bearers had no sooner reached the field,
than the Germans, seeing them, commenced firing with
small shells at point-blank range over open sights.</p>

<p>Three of the stretcher-bearers went down, two of
them mortally wounded. I ran quickly to them and
began to anoint one of them. The other bearers ran
to points of safety and I was alone on the field. Those
were the most terrible minutes of my life. I knew the
enemy could see me and was firing at me for shells
were crashing all about me. Terrified, I crouched flat
on my stomach until I finished anointing the lad, who
passed away before I had done my work. Then I
rolled over and lay still, as if I were dead; a little
later, I crawled from shell hole to shell hole, off the
field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>When the roll was called that night seventy-one
men out of six hundred answered. We had lost many
prisoners.</p>

<p>I could not find my battalion to march out with
them. I had not eaten any food all day and it was
now six o’clock. I had gone through the most terrible
day of my life, and I was utterly dispirited. I
had never before felt so strangely. Of course, we
had had many engagements during the past week, and
constantly I had been looking on men mangled and
broken and torn; and, besides I had eaten scarcely
anything. I seemed to be moving in a world that
was all upset; somehow, suddenly, everything had
gone wrong with the allies! I bumped along till finally
I came to the dugout that had been occupied by
the medical officer of the Fourteenth. He had gone,
but he had left behind a white bag, resembling in size
and shape an ordinary pillow-slip, half filled with
sugar. I thought of taking it along with me, but I
left it. As I moved on dazedly, suddenly I remembered
I had seen the Fifteenth back in reserve. I
had come through them in the morning on my way up
to the Fourteenth. I would go to them and ask for
something to eat. How I missed George! George
would have had a breakfast for me in the morning,
and would have found me in the evening.</p>

<p>Headquarters of the Fifteenth were in a cellar, and
a kind-hearted kilted laddie guided me to the door.
I was greeted very kindly, and in a little while the
waiter placed on the table some white bread and margarine
and a plate of cold beef.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“I’m sorry,” said Major Girvin, O. C., of the Fifteenth
Battalion, “that we have no sugar, Padre.”</p>

<p>I then remembered the bag of sugar I had seen in
the medical officer’s hut. If I had only brought it,
I could have given it to the Fifteenth Battalion!
I did not mind the lack of sugar in the tea. And I
was not bothered that most of the smoke from the improvised
fire-place was floating out over the cellar
instead of rising through the chimney. But I began
to feel my spirits revive with the kindly talk of the
officers. They seemed pleased that I had dropped in
on them. The Fifteenth was the one battalion of the
brigade that had no chaplain. They used to say jokingly
that they were so good that they did not need
a chaplain.</p>

<p>I related my experiences of the day to the officers.
They were sympathetic, for they had had many similar
ones.</p>

<p>I stayed with them for an hour or two till the Twenty-sixth
Battalion came to relieve them. The officer
who took over from us was an old friend, and one of
the very best Catholics of the old One Hundred and
Thirty-Second Battalion. I was delighted to see Captain
Barry and we talked for a long time in the cellar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XCIII<br />


<small><span class="smcap">In Reserve</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>During the night we marched back to Inchy. Very
early in the morning I found the transport of the
Fourteenth and, later in the day, the remnants of
the battalion. They were in reserve, some miles from
the firing line, yet in a very hard-shelled area; to make
matters worse, we were in an ammunition dump, one
of the largest I had ever seen. It was a very poor
place to bring men to rest after battle!</p>

<p>There was a little Catholic chapel-tent here, similar
to the one we had had at Ecurie Wood. In the afternoon
I went up to this and found Father O’Sullivan
of the First Divisional Engineers in charge. I slept
in the chapel-tent that night. Just before I retired,
a number of lads came in to see me. The last one
was a runner from the Fourteenth. He had had a
terrible time carrying messages to different companies
of the battalion in the battle the previous day. He
showed me his tunic, from which a bullet had torn a
strip across the chest. He had only begun to speak of
his narrow escape when he burst out crying and immediately
left the tent. Father O’Sullivan was sleeping
down in the lines of the engineers. The shelling
was terrible; beyond description. Not far away whole
train-loads of munitions were being hit by German
shells and car after car was exploding with a deafening
noise. A great many horses were being hit, for there
were horse lines of the artillery nearby. Shell after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
shell was dropping around my tent; but I felt too
tired to move. I remember my conscience bothering
me a little as to whether I were justified in remaining
in the tent when at any minute I might be blown up.
After a little puzzling, I decided I was, and for this
reason—perhaps, in looking for a place of safety, I
might be struck by one of the shells. And at any
minute Fritz might stop.</p>

<p>I said Mass the following morning, and no words
can express the consolation it gave me. I had not
said Mass for five days—not since the previous Sunday.
We remained another night, but the shelling was
so intense that it was no fit place for troops to rest in:
so on Saturday afternoon we marched farther back.
Many men whom we thought had been taken prisoners
found their way back to the battalion; they had become
separated from their companies and had lain
hidden in shell-holes till they could come back in
safety. As we now numbered nearly three hundred,
we did not present an unfavorable appearance as we
marched along. The band at the head of the column
played “The Great Little Army” and “Sons of the
Brave” and many other old favorites; already the
lads were becoming more cheerful.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XCIV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Frequent Moves</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was afternoon when we came into our area, and
it was Saturday. The doctor and I had been given a
hut almost filled with German high explosives—barrels
of cordite, rolls of gun-cotton and boxes of amenol
were on all sides. There was just room for us to spread
two bed-rolls on the floor. Woe unto any one who
smoked in this powder magazine! The cook-house was
almost touching us, and sparks flew from the short
stove-pipe that pierced the low roof. If a spark or
two should happen to fall on our little room! The
doctor became uneasy, and hearing that a field ambulance
was quartered a few hundred feet away he left
and found shelter with his brethren.</p>

<p>During the afternoon we received a draft of three
hundred fresh men to reinforce our shattered ranks.
I watched them as they stood to attention and were inspected
by the colonel. Tomorrow I would have them
at Mass, for it would be Sunday.</p>

<p>Sunday morning the wind was blowing a rather stiff
breeze, and as I was to say Mass out of doors, I knew
it would be impossible to keep my candles lighted
unless I should build a windshield—or break-wind.
Accordingly, at nine o’clock I called the Englishman
who had been appointed to look after my wants, and
we went up to the field and tried to build the windshield.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour we labored unsuccessfully with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the material we had at hand. I was quite discouraged
when I heard the pipes of the Thirteenth Battalion
coming up the road—and I had no place arranged to
say Mass! I looked around, not knowing what to do
next, and there, not more than a hundred yards away
stood the remnants of the corner walls of a house—exactly
what I had been trying to build. The two
walls were just about five feet high and there was a
trough about two feet high and three feet long built
into the corner. Quickly the Englishman and I filled
this with brick and in five minutes my altar was fitted
up and ready for Mass.</p>

<p>I had been told by the staff captain of the brigade
to hurry, as the place where I was to say Mass was
under German observation. I said Mass very quickly,
dispensed with the sermon, and gave a general absolution
to the men as they knelt on the green field
among piles of shattered masonry.</p>

<p>That evening we moved back to support trenches
and I was not sorry to leave my munition store-room.
The doctor and I were given a dugout to ourselves.
As it was very cold, we made a little trench heater out
of an old bean-tin, cutting a number of holes in the
sides of it and filling it with pieces of paraffine candles
and torn shreds of burlap. When we set fire to this
we had quite a brazier. Headquarters was some distance
from our trench in a corrugated iron hut, and as
Fritz was shelling a balloon headquarters not far
away, we often had to run the gauntlet of shell-fire.</p>

<p>We remained here nearly a week and it was relatively
quiet. On October 9th, when we went over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
lunch, the colonel told us that the Canadians had taken
Cambrai. The taking of Cambrai closed the battle of
Arras-Cambrai, begun on August 26th, after we had
come back from Amiens. From this date the Canadian
Corps had advanced twenty-three miles, fighting
for every yard of ground and overcoming tremendous
obstacles. We had taken over eighteen thousand prisoners,
three hundred and seventy guns and two thousand
machine-guns.</p>

<p>We held the front line for a few days, then came out
to reserve, where the Prince of Wales reviewed us.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XCV<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Somaine</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>On October 17th word was brought that the Germans
were falling back. The following day we crossed
the Canal de la Sensee. Cyclists, cavalry and motor
machine-guns were in immediate pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p>I shall never forget Saturday, October 19th, on
which day word was brought to us by runners that
there was a thickly populated city not far away called
Somaine, from which the enemy were marching out.
In a little while we would be marching in.</p>

<p>It was evening when the draft I was accompanying
marched into Somaine. The band was accompanying
us. It had been silent for quite a while, as we did not
know but that some lurking nest of machine-gunners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
might be near to fire on us. It was dark as we passed
the first group of houses near the city. I suppose the
soldiers were wondering why the band was silent, for
it was our invariable custom to play when entering a
town.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the rear of the ranks, a voice calls
out in the darkness: “Give us the band!” And then,
“Good old band!” says another voice above the swinging,
grating sound of marching feet over muddy cobblestones.
Then there is a great medley of calls, of
which the motif is “Band! Band!” “Give us the
band!”</p>

<p>Usually when the lads voice their request for music
the band always plays. Tonight, however, the lads
call longer than usual and the young officer wrinkles
his brow a little as he wonders if it would be wise to
give the order. He begins to think that the responsibilities
of a subordinate officer are great. Meanwhile,
the lads keep calling for the band. Finally, the young
officer decides to risk it and word goes relayed up to
the bandmaster: “Let’s have the band.”</p>

<p>The bandmaster turns slightly in the darkness and
calls out, “Over There.” The bandsmen swing their
instruments into position, while insistent demands for
the band still come shouted from the rear of the ranks.
The lads do not yet know that orders to play have
been given.</p>

<p>The snare-drums roll; the large drum booms three
times, twice; there is a clash and a clang of cymbals.
A cheer of satisfaction goes up from the marching lads.
Then clearly in the darkness sound the inspiring notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
of “Over There.” As we march down the streets,
doors fly open in the houses and grateful French peasants,
who have been prisoners of the Germans for
the last four years, come running to the street: old
men standing by the wayside and, holding their hats
in their hands, bow their heads. Women pass waffles
and cups of coffee to the men, and little children run
up and down the pavement shouting and dancing in
their glee. But no bells ring from towers. These
have been taken long ago to be melted into bullets and
made into shells.</p>

<p>We were billeted in very comfortable quarters in
the town of Somaine. I called on the old curé and
made arrangements for Mass for my lads the following
morning. He asked me if I could say Mass at nine
o’clock, as his Mass was to be at ten. This was done,
and at ten o’clock I returned to the church to be present
at the Mass of the parish.</p>

<p>The church was crowded with people as the old
priest, looking like the curé of Ars, with his beautiful
white hair hanging down to his shoulders, came to the
altar. He was naturally rather pale, but today his
thin face was flushed and his clear blue eyes were
lighted by excitement. I could not keep my eyes from
the straight old figure that went so quickly up into the
pulpit and faced his people.</p>

<p>“Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro!”—“Let us
give thanks to the Lord Our God!” The words ring
clearly out over the church. One wonders at the
strength and clearness of the priest’s voice. As he
continues: “Thirty years ago, my dear friends, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
I received the holy oils of priesthood those words of
gratitude came to my mind. Five years ago, when I
knelt at the feet of our Sovereign Pontiff to receive
his blessing on the occasion of my silver jubilee of
priesthood, again I said those words: ‘Gratias agamus
Domino Deo nostro’—‘Let us give thanks to the Lord
our God.’ But today as I stand at the altar of God,
knowing that my people are free, knowing that after
four years of continued intercession of the Sacred Heart
of Jesus our prayer has been heard, my heart breaks
forth in gratitude the like of which I have never before
experienced. ‘Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro’—‘Let
us give thanks to the Lord our God’!”</p>

<p>Then the old priest continued his sermon, asking his
people if they did not remember how he had told them
never to give up; to keep on praying; that surely their
prayers would be heard. Many eyes were wet when
he finished his sermon.</p>

<p>The following day, we pursued the enemy a few
miles, for he was still retreating, but on Tuesday we
were ordered back to rest. My brigade was in Fenain
and Somaine and I was billeted with the saintly old

<small><span class="smcap">The End Draws Near</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Every day for about a week troops were almost continuously
passing through Somaine and all the heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
guns were being brought up. Soon railway communications
were established and some of the people of the
city were making visits to Paris.</p>

<p>Every evening I used to sit with the curé in his little
kitchen before the fire and tell him stories of the war.
The old priest was kept very busy; his assistant, a young
priest, had been taken, together with all the men of
military age, by the Germans in their retreat. Almost
every day I saw the hearse drawn up before his church
and I knew another funeral cortege was soon to pass
along the way. He spoke to me one evening of the
frequent deaths, and then added: “The people are
dying of joy.” True, the people had been so weakened
through hunger that many were not able to stand the
great joy of deliverance. It was pitiful to see the little
boys and girls playing in the street. At first it seemed
to me that they were all too tall for their years; then
I knew it was that they were under-nourished.</p>

<p>A touching incident occurred one day when I was
called upon to bury a Catholic lad from one of the
battalions of the Third Division, then fighting towards
Valenciennes. As I read the prayers over him, a little
French girl of about eight or nine years approached
the grave, carrying in her hand an oblong box of
Canadian biscuits. The little one was holding the box
close to her side. I assumed that one of our lads had
given it to her; they were forever doing such kind acts.
Presently she saw that it was one of her gallant liberators
over whom I was saying the last prayers. Immediately
she began to sob and the big tears ran down
her cheeks. She actually shook in a paroxysm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
grief. It was hard for the lads standing near, and for
me, to go on with our work. Always during the war
our hearts had been steeled, not knowing what was to
come next. In a few minutes the mother came from
somewhere behind us, took the child by the arm and
gently led her away.</p>

<p>We were in Somaine nearly three weeks and the men
were greatly benefited by the rest. I recall a humorous
incident that occurred during our stay there. One
day the curé of Fenain, which was just five minutes’
run on my bicycle from Somaine, invited me over to a
disinterment that was to take place in his cemetery.
Having seen enough of gruesome things, I politely declined
to be present. Then as I saw the curé’s face
break into a smile, I felt there must be some joke, so
I promised to attend.</p>

<p>In my presence the casket was exhumed, and lo!
gentle reader, there appeared beautiful vestments and
precious altar-vessels, together with the municipal
books and documents. Then the curé told me the
story. The coffin had been filled with its strange contents
and drawn solemnly in the hearse through the
streets just as the Germans had taken over the town;
and as the funeral procession moved through the street
the Germans themselves had saluted through respect
to the “Dead!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">November Eleventh</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>November came, and I helped the parish priest of
Somaine to give Holy Communion to the vast crowds
of his people who received on All Saints Day. In return,
he helped me with the confessions of my men,
for now nearly all the members of the Fourteenth
Battalion and very many of the Thirteenth were
French-speaking soldiers. I was beginning to feel that
all were ready spiritually for more battles when November
11th arrived and we learned that hostilities
had ceased.</p>

<p>If this were fiction, I might write a lengthy description
of how the troops went wild with joy, etc., etc.;
but as it is the truth, I am constrained to say we took
it in a strangely quiet manner. We could only look
at each other and say: “Well, it’s over at last!” and
we would add, “thank God!” Perhaps we were dazed
by the good news. Perhaps it was that the terrible
experience of war had left us incapable of expressing
our emotion. Perhaps these verses from “The Citizen
of No Man’s Land,” by Roselle Mercier Montgomery,
express the strange tension that had come to us during
the war:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Why is it that, although we settle down</div>
<div class="verse">And live the lives we lived, a strange unrest,</div>

<div class="verse">A restlessness too vague to be exprest?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
<div class="verse">Is it that we who, out there, walked with Death</div>

<small><span class="smcap">Through Belgium</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>The evening of the Armistice I was sitting with the
old curé of Somaine when the Englishman came up to
tell me that orders had come for the brigade to march
in the morning. We were to follow the retiring Germans,
who had promised as one of the conditions of
the Armistice to withdraw to a certain number of
miles on the opposite side of the Rhine.</p>

<p>I looked at the old curé; I had just been telling him
that I expected a long rest now. And here we were
to traverse all Belgium on foot, and continue through
the Rhineland of Germany till we reached the opposite
bank of the Rhine!</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning, after I had received
Holy Communion from the hand of the saintly old
curé—I did not have time to say Mass—I left. It
was a long march before us, yet we did not foresee that
it was going to be interesting. We reached the border
between France and Belgium before the end of the
week. We descended a long hill, the band at the head
of the column playing the “Marseillaise,” while on both
sides of the road from many windows waved the tricolor
of France. We then crossed a small bridge over
a dyke, in the middle of which stood a pole about six
feet high; at the top of the pole was a small metal
sign-board about a foot long and eight inches high,
running parallel with the road. On the end nearest
us was the one word “France,” then a little line about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
one inch long, then the word “Belgique.” So we
stepped from France into Belgium, and the band, which
was the first to cross the line, having ceased to play
the “Marseillaise” began “La Brabaconne,” the national
anthem of the Belgians.</p>

<p>We spent our first Sunday in a little place called
Quaregnon, where we witnessed a demonstration of
the wonderful patriotism of the Belgians. The church
was crowded and after Mass the curé in stole and cope,
intoned the “Te Deum.” Instantly all present took it
up, and the great volume of sound filled the church as
Belgian, Frenchman and Canadian joined in the mighty
hymn of thanksgiving. Then the little curé did something
I had never seen done before: he turned towards
the people and cried, “Long live Belgium, free, and independent!”
The people repeated his words. Then he
cried, “Long live the Canadians, our liberators!” and
as he passed to the sacristy a full orchestra played “Le
Sambre et Meuse,” while a number of the congregation
joined in this war-song of the French.</p>

<p>At one place where we stopped a tall, thin priest
spoke to me of the summer when the Germans had
passed through—it seemed so long ago now, that
summer of 1914—when great train-loads of enemy
soldiers passed his house daily. He recalled one train
in particular: the cars were gaily decorated with
flowers, bunting and flags, and from the engine floated
a big white pennant on which was printed: “William
of Germany, Emperor of Europe.” He recalled the
endless battalions that passed along the highway, fully
equipped from boot to helmet, marching in perfect order.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Their horses, too, were in excellent condition.
Their wagons were shining. Every little while a voice
from the ranks would call out, “Näch Paris! Näch
Paris!”—“On to Paris! On to Paris!” and little Belgian
children, terrified, scurried to cellar or other hiding
places. “Yesterday,” continued the priest, “I
saw the last of the German army pass through on their
return march to Germany. They had scarcely any
horses; and those that they had were extremely thin.
Men were hauling wagons and carts. Their uniforms
were worn and soiled; in fact, many were nondescript.
Yesterday many of the boys remembering the words
the Germans had called out on their way, four years
before, standing on pavement or in doorways called
out: ‘Näch Paris! Näch Paris!’—‘On to Paris! On
to Paris!’”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant marching off early every morning
while the band played some old favorite that had
cheered the weary men after a hard day on the battlefield.
All along the way, for the first week or two,
we were greeted by happy peasants, who had been
refugees for years, returning to their own country.
Nearly always they pulled hand-carts piled high with
bedding and gaily decorated with flags of the allies.</p>

<p>I remember once on the roadside we found that the
railway track had been blown up, and a great length
of rails, with the sleepers still attached, had been
thrown completely over a two-story building, like a
wide, curving ladder.</p>

<p>I found the Belgian priests very hospitable and very
much interested in conditions in America. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
filled with gratitude to the people of the United States.</p>

<p>In many shop windows we saw a picture representing
the ocean, and Columbia passing bread across the
waters to an emaciated woman sitting on the shore
with two starving children near her. In the upper part
of the picture were insets of President Wilson and
Brand Whitlock, and underneath was written: “Grateful
Belgium.”</p>

<p>I was in a little town not far from Brussels the day
the king came back. Most of the broken railways had
not yet been repaired, and as the Germans had taken
the horses away from the people, many walked from
ten to twenty miles to see the king come back to his
kingdom.</p>

<p>We marched by Waterloo and through an old monastery
called Villers L’Abbey, built by St. Bernard. In
one place where we halted over night was a tiny three-nave
church of grey granite, which had been built in
the ninth century. Napoleon had stopped here once
in passing and had given a crown of gold for one of
the statues. It was the finest three-nave church in the
world. It was pure Roman architecture.</p>

<p>Gradually we were drawing nearer the German border.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Chapter XCIX<br />


<small><span class="smcap">Through the Rhineland</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>Shortly before we reached the frontier one of the
officers came into the mess and said to me: “It may
be a little exciting crossing the line, Padre. I hear
there are some revolutionists who are going to snipe
at us.”</p>

<p>I did not care for this kind of excitement. I felt
I had seen all I wanted of shooting for the rest of my
life. There was no need to worry, however, for our
march into Germany was a very peaceful one. But nobody
cheered us; no flags waved; everything was silent
in the land as our khaki swung through the winding
road. We passed through a very hilly country, and we
soon had evidence that it was a Catholic country, for
all along our march were little wayside shrines.</p>

<p>Our first billet was a low, white farmhouse, very
comfortably furnished. On the wall of our mess was
an oleograph of the Holy Family; a similar copy had
hung in my bed-room when I was a boy. Presently
an old lady came in, looked at me and said something.
I replied in French, but she shook her head. I pointed
to the oleograph and said, “Katholisch?”</p>

<p>The old lady looked at me, beaming. I pointed to
myself and said, “Katholisch,” and then added, “Prester,”
as I thought this was the German word for priest.
During my stay in that house I was treated as the
Catholic priest is always treated by the humble.</p>

<p>In one place a young woman, learning that I was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
priest, came to me with her brother, who spoke excellent
English; he had been a waiter in the Savoy Hotel,
in London, previous to the war. The husband of the
young woman had been killed in the war, and passing
me her offering, she asked if I would say Mass for the
repose of his soul the following morning in the village
church. This I did, and while I said Mass the village
choir sang two hymns. It was a low Mass I said, and
in the color of the day. I asked the young man the
name of the hymns and he told me. I cannot recall
the name of the first one: but I think the second was
entitled “O Komm O Komm Emanuel.” It must have
been an Advent hymn, for I heard it almost every
morning as I said Mass in those little churches of the
Rhineland.</p>

<p>I have never seen such excellent Catholics: every
morning the village church would be crowded as if it
were Sunday. Sometimes I gave communion to German
people who came reverently to the rails.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly and at last on December
12th, we arrived in the city of Cologne. The following
morning we marched across the Rhine, while the band
played the “Regimental March” and “The British
Grenadier;” the men with fixed bayonets marched
rigidly to attention. Some officers near me sang softly
the words: “When we wind up the watch on the
Rhine.”</p>

<p>We marched about twelve miles beyond the Rhine
to a little place called Altenbruick. Here we halted.
And it was here that I said good-bye to the battalion
on Christmas Day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>We had Midnight Mass in the German church on the
hill overlooking the village. Father Madden, who had
returned to his battalion after being discharged from
hospital, came to help me with confessions. My lads
were scattered over different parishes, but I had arranged
for church parades for all who could come. I
heard confessions from seven p. m. till midnight, and
as the clock struck the midnight hour one of my lads
from the Fourteenth began to sing that beautiful
Christmas hymn which was being sung that night in
French churches all over Canada, “Minuit, Chretiens”
(Holy Night). Every Christmas, just at midnight, I
had heard it sung in the basilica of old Quebec, where
I had made my studies for the priesthood. And as the
clear, strong voice sang those beautiful notes of
Gounod’s famous composition, memories of peace swept
over my soul. I had seen horrible things; but now they
were past and this was the night of the Christ Child,
when the angels sang “peace on earth to men of good
will.”</p>

<p>I was fully vested, and was about to proceed to the
altar for the last time before these lads, when the German
parish priest came in to the sacristy. He spoke
quickly in French, telling me that at the communion I
need not descend to the rails; that he would give communion
to my men.</p>

<p>For an instant I seemed dazed. I had brought the
Bread of Life so often to many of those soldiers and
officers who now waited for me to draw near to the
altar of God. Very likely I should never have the opportunity
of again ministering to them. But, then, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
thought, this German priest wishes to give communion
to my lads. Centuries before, the angels had sung:
“Peace to men of good will.” I must show good will.
Yet how hard it was! Then, mastering a great reluctance,
I said quietly: “Very well, Father, you will
give communion to my men.”</p>

<p>So this is the last memory I hold of those wonderful
soldier lads—the Midnight Mass at Altenbruick. The
sound of the voice of the German priest, “Corpus
Domini Nostri Jesu Christi,” etc., as he dispensed the
mysteries of God to my soldier lads! And, above all
else, the presence in our midst of Jesus of Nazareth,
the Saviour of the world—The Prince of Peace!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">L’Envoi</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>It is all over now, yet often I think of those wonderful
days; of long night marches; of long days of weary
waiting; of quiet resting-places, with their rows and
rows of “little green tents” and small white crosses,
landmarks of our warfare in France and Flanders.
Sometimes I think of all those lads who answered so
quickly the final roll-call; and my thoughts go back to
those nights in France where such great numbers knelt
to ask pardon of God, and to become fortified with
the Bread of the Strong. Many of those lads I ushered
up to the gates of heaven, which swung open to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
so soon after they had left me. Now “they are numbered
amongst the children of God and their lot is
with the saints.”</p>

<p>They do not forget me. Sometimes, when the force
of circumstances presses greatly and the way along
which I must walk seems exceptionally hard, I call
on them to stand by. I ask them simply to remember
Arras, Amiens, Cherisy Valley, Canal du Nord and
Cambrai, then—I feel those lads are praying for me.</p>

<p>And sometimes “when thoughts of the last bitter
hour come like a pall over my spirit,” a thought most
comforting comes to my mind. I see in imagination
the street of heaven and, coming marching towards
me, great hosts, their faces lighted with the Vision of
God. I see them turned towards me, as I have seen
them so often on battlefield and in hospital ward. That
look of loving trust is there—only so many times
glorified! They look at me, who am a little dismayed,
a little afraid. Then I hear their voices: “Come,
Father, your billet is ready!”</p>

<p>Then I feel very confident, for I know that my warfare
is over, that I am going back to rest—back to
Eternal Rest.</p>
